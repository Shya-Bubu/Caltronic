# CalTronic V2 Content Status
# 
# This file is AUTO-GENERATED and provides a snapshot of content status.
# DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY - run `npm run validate-content` to update.
#
# The single source of truth for module/lesson definitions is:
# - src/app/data/modules.ts (what the app displays)
# - src/content/[module]/ (actual content files)
#
# To add new content:
# 1. Copy _lesson-template folder to src/content/[module]/lessons/
# 2. Create concepts in src/content/[module]/concepts/
# 3. Update src/app/data/modules.ts with the new lesson
# 4. Run `npm run validate-content` to verify
