# Continuous-Time Fourier Transform

The Fourier Transform extends frequency analysis from periodic signals to ALL signals. It reveals the complete frequency content of any aperiodic signal.

## What You'll Learn

1. **CTFT Basics**: Transform definition, inverse transform, key pairs
2. **Transform Properties**: Time/frequency duality, convolution theorem
3. **Frequency Response**: How LTI systems process different frequencies

## Key Insight

For Fourier series: discrete spectrum (harmonics only)
For Fourier transform: continuous spectrum (all frequencies)
