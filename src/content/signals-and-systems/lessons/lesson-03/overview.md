# Convolution and LTI Systems

Convolution is THE mathematical operation that defines how LTI systems transform signals. If you know a system's impulse response $h(t)$, convolution tells you the output for ANY input.

## What You'll Learn

1. **Convolution Fundamentals**: The integral/sum that connects input, impulse response, and output
2. **LTI Impulse Response**: How systems are completely characterized by their response to an impulse
3. **Convolution Properties**: Commutativity, associativity, distributivity, and their practical implications

## Why This Matters

Convolution appears EVERYWHERE in engineering:
- Audio effects (reverb, echo)
- Image filtering (blur, edge detection)
- Communication systems (matched filtering)
- Neural networks (convolutional layers)

Master convolution, and you unlock the analysis of virtually any LTI system.
