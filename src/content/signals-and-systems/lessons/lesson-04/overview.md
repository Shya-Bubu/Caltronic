# Fourier Series Part I

The Fourier series is one of the most beautiful and powerful tools in signal analysis. It reveals that ANY periodic signal is actually a sum of sinusoids at harmonically related frequencies.

## What You'll Learn

1. **Fourier Series Introduction**: The fundamental idea of frequency decomposition
2. **Exponential Fourier Series**: Computing coefficients using complex exponentials  
3. **Fourier Series Properties**: Time-shifting, scaling, and symmetry properties

## Why This Matters

Fourier analysis transforms TIME-domain problems into FREQUENCY-domain problems, often making them dramatically simpler. It's the foundation for:
- Audio and music analysis
- Communication system design
- Filter design and implementation
- Image compression (JPEG, MP3)
