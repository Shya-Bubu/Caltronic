# Lesson 07 Synthesis

## Stability Criteria

**BIBO Stable (Causal)**: All poles have Re(s) < 0 (left half-plane)

**Marginally Stable**: Simple poles on jω-axis, no repeated poles there

**Unstable**: Any pole with Re(s) > 0 OR repeated poles on jω-axis

## Summary

Pole locations determine:
- Stability (left/right of jω-axis)
- Oscillation frequency (imaginary part)
- Decay/growth rate (real part)
