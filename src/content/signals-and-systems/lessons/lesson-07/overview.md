# Stability and Pole-Zero Analysis

The location of poles in the s-plane tells you everything about system stability. This lesson connects mathematical analysis to physical system behavior.

## What You'll Learn

1. **Stability Analysis**: BIBO stability, pole locations, marginally stable systems

## Key Insight

For causal LTI systems: **All poles in left half-plane = STABLE**
