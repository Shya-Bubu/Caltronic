# Impulse Functions and Systems

In this lesson, we explore the mathematical foundations that bridge signals and systems. The **unit impulse** (delta function) is one of the most important signals in systems analysis—it allows us to completely characterize any linear time-invariant (LTI) system through its impulse response.

We'll also classify systems based on key properties like **memory**, **causality**, **time-invariance**, and **linearity**. These classifications determine how we can analyze and design systems in practice.

## What You'll Learn

1. **Delta Functions and Unit Impulse**: Understanding the mathematical definition, properties, and physical interpretation of impulse functions
2. **System Classifications**: Categorizing systems by their structural and behavioral properties
3. **Signal Transformations**: Mastering time-domain operations like shifting, scaling, and reflection

## Why This Matters

The impulse function is the "DNA" of a system—knowing how a system responds to an impulse tells us how it responds to ANY input. This fundamental principle underlies everything from filter design to image processing to communication systems.

System classifications help us choose the right mathematical tools. For example, knowing a system is LTI allows us to use powerful techniques like convolution and frequency analysis.
