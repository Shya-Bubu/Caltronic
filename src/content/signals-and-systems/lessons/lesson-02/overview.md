# Lesson 02: Impulse Function and System Properties

> **Central Theme**: The impulse function is engineering's way of modeling instantaneous events, and understanding system classification is fundamental to all signal processing and control applications.

## What You'll Learn

This lesson bridges theoretical mathematics with practical engineering. You'll master one of the most important functions in signals and systems—the impulse function—and learn how to classify and model real-world systems.

### Core Concepts

1. **Impulse & Unit Step Functions**  
   The delta function is a "controlled infinity"—it lets us mathematically model instantaneous spikes and discontinuities that occur in real systems.

2. **System Classification & Modeling**  
   Learn to distinguish continuous vs discrete systems and represent them using differential or difference equations.

3. **System Interconnections & Feedback**  
   Understand how systems connect in series, parallel, and feedback configurations—the foundation of control theory.

## Why This Matters

Every module you'll take from here forward depends on this foundation:
- **Automatic Control** (5th sem): Feedback systems
- **Digital Signal Processing** (5th sem): Discrete-time systems  
- **Communication Systems** (6th sem): System modeling
- **Power Systems** (7th sem): Differential equations

The impulse function specifically lets you:
- Analyze system responses to sudden inputs
- Model discontinuities mathematically
- Understand the relationship between differentiation and integration

## Prerequisites

- Lesson 01: Signal and system foundations
- Basic calculus (derivatives and integrals)
- Understanding of continuous vs discrete signals

## Estimated Time

**3-4 hours** to complete all concepts with practice problems
