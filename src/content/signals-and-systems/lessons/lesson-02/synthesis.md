# Lesson 02 Synthesis

You've now built a solid foundation in system theory by mastering three critical concepts:

## Key Takeaways

**Delta Functions**: The unit impulse δ(t) is the mathematical foundation for system analysis. While it's not a traditional function (infinite height, zero width, unit area), it's an incredibly useful abstraction that allows us to:
- Represent signals as sums/integrals of shifted impulses
- Characterize systems through their impulse response
- Perform convolution operations

**System Properties**: Every system can be classified along multiple dimensions:
- **Memory**: Does output depend on past/future inputs?
- **Causality**: Does output depend only on present/past?
- **Time-Invariance**: Does behavior change over time?
- **Linearity**: Does superposition hold?

These properties determine which analysis techniques we can apply.

**Signal Transformations**: Time-domain operations (shifting, scaling, reflection) are fundamental building blocks. Mastering these transformations is essential for understanding convolution, Fourier analysis, and filter design.

## Looking Ahead

With these tools, you're ready to tackle **convolution**—the mathematical operation that describes how LTI systems transform signals. Convolution combines impulse response with signal transformations to give us a complete picture of system behavior.
