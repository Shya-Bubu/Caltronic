# Laplace Transform Basics

The Laplace transform extends Fourier analysis to handle signals that grow or decay—essential for analyzing real system behavior including transients and stability.

## What You'll Learn

1. **Laplace Transform**: The s-domain, ROC, and relationship to Fourier
2. **Transfer Functions**: H(s) as the complete system characterization

## Why Laplace?

Fourier transform requires absolute integrability. Laplace adds a converging factor $e^{-\sigma t}$ to analyze growing signals and determine stability.
