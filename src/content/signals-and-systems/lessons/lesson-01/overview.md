# Signal Fundamentals and Classifications

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Define signals and systems using the input-output model
- Classify signals by time (continuous vs discrete)
- Calculate energy and power of signals
- Decompose signals into even and odd components
- Identify periodic signals and calculate their period

## Prerequisites
- Basic calculus (integration)
- Complex numbers and Euler's formula
- Trigonometry fundamentals
