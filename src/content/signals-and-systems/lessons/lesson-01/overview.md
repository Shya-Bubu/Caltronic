## What You'll Learn

This lesson introduces the fundamental vocabulary that powers all of electrical engineering. By the end, you'll understand:

- **What signals are** — and why they're everywhere
- **What systems do** — transform inputs into outputs
- **How to classify signals** — continuous vs discrete, deterministic vs random
- **Energy and power** — the two fundamental signal metrics
- **How to sketch signals** — from equations to graphs

## Why This Matters

Signals and systems is not just another module. It's the **language** that connects:

| Field | How S&S Applies |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Communications** | Modulation, channel modeling, noise analysis |
| **Control Systems** | Feedback, stability, system response |
| **Power Engineering** | Load analysis, power quality |
| **DSP** | Filtering, FFT, audio/video processing |
| **AI/ML** | Signal features, time-series analysis |
