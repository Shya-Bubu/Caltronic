            "prompt": "The unit step u(t) equals:",
            "options": [
                "0 for all t",
                "1 for t â‰¥ 0, 0 for t < 0",
                "1 for all t",
                "t for t â‰¥ 0"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "1 for t â‰¥ 0, 0 for t < 0",
            "explanation": "The unit step is the fundamental 'switch' function: zero before t=0, one at and after t=0. It's used to 'turn on' signals at specific times and build other functions."

            "options": [
                "-3",

                "0",
                "Undefined"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "3",
            "explanation": "The absolute value |t| gives the magnitude (distance from zero) regardless of sign. |-3| = 3. This is elementary but crucial for understanding symmetric pulse functions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Even",
            "explanation": "Any function f(|t|) is always even (symmetric about t=0) because f(|-t|) = f(|t|). The absolute value removes sign information, creating symmetry."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "-1 to 1",
            "explanation": "The rect function rect(t/Ï„) is 1 for |t| â‰¤ Ï„/2. With Ï„=2, it's non-zero for |t| â‰¤ 1, which means from t = -1 to t = 1."

            "id": "q5",
            "prompt": "To shift x(t) right by 3, use:",
            "options": [
                "x(t + 3)",

                "x(t/3)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "x(t - 3)",
            "explanation": "To shift RIGHT by a positive amount a, use x(t - a). The minus sign causes rightward shift. x(t + 3) would shift LEFT by 3. x(3t) compresses."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6",

                "Shifted"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Narrower",
            "explanation": "Multiplying t by a factor > 1 compresses (narrows) the signal in time. x(2t) is half as wide as x(t). Events happen faster. This is time scaling."
        },

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "2T",
            "explanation": "tri(t/T) is non-zero from -T to +T, giving total base width = T - (-T) = 2T. The peak is at t=0 with height 1. This is standard definition."
        },

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Pulse from -2 to 2",
            "explanation": "u(t+2) turns on at t=-2. u(t-2) turns on at t=2. Their difference is 1 only where the first is on but second is off: from t=-2 to t=2."
        },

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "1",
            "explanation": "Substituting t=0: 1 - |0|/T = 1 - 0 = 1. This is the peak of the triangular pulse. The function decreases linearly from this maximum."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10",
            "prompt": "A pulse from t=1 to t=5 with height 2 can be written as:",

            "correctAnswer": "2rect((t-3)/4)",
            "explanation": "Center is at (1+5)/2 = 3. Width is 5-1 = 4. So use rect((t-3)/4) for the shape, multiply by 2 for height. This gives the correct position, width, and amplitude."
