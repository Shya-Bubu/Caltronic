# Summary: Signal Sketching Basics

**If you remember only this, remember these:**

1. **Piecewise notation**: Different expressions for different time ranges
2. $|t|$ creates **symmetry** around $t = 0$
3. $u(t)$ is the unit step — turns "on" at $t = 0$
4. **rect** = flat top pulse; **tri** = peaked triangle
5. Always **label axes** and key values when sketching

> **Why This Matters**
> This skill appears in EVERY signals exam.
> Convolution, Fourier transforms, and system analysis all require signal sketching.
