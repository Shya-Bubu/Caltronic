            "prompt": "The fundamental frequency ω₀ for a signal with period T is:",
            "options": [
                "T",
                "1/T",
                "2π/T",
                "T/2π"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "2π/T",
            "explanation": "The fundamental angular frequency is ω₀ = 2π/T rad/s. In Hz, it would be f₀ = 1/T. All other harmonics are integer multiples of this frequency: 2ω₀, 3ω₀, 4ω₀, etc."

            "id": "fs-q2",
            "prompt": "A square wave contains which harmonics?",
            "options": [
                "All harmonics",
                "Only even harmonics",
                "Only odd harmonics",
                "No harmonics"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Only odd harmonics",
            "explanation": "Due to half-wave symmetry, a square wave has only odd harmonics: 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc. The coefficients decrease as 1/k, so higher harmonics contribute less. This creates the characteristic 'ringing' at transitions."
        },
        {
            "id": "fs-q3",
            "prompt": "c₀ in the Fourier series represents:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "DC component",
            "explanation": "c₀ is the average value (DC) of the signal over one period: c₀ = (1/T)∫x(t)dt. It's the 0th 'harmonic'—a constant offset. For signals symmetric about zero, c₀ = 0."

            "id": "fs-q4",
            "prompt": "Sinusoids are eigenfunctions of LTI systems because:",

                "They're continuous"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Input frequency = output frequency",
            "explanation": "When a sinusoid e^(jωt) goes through an LTI system, output is H(ω)·e^(jωt)—same frequency, just scaled. The system cannot create new frequencies. This is why Fourier analysis is so powerful for LTI systems."

            "correctAnswer": "cₖ = c₋ₖ*",
            "explanation": "Real signals have conjugate symmetric coefficients: c₋ₖ = cₖ*. This ensures that when positive and negative exponentials combine, imaginary parts cancel and the result is real. Magnitude spectrum is even: |cₖ| = |c₋ₖ|."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Amplitude of k-th harmonic",
            "explanation": "The magnitude |cₖ| gives the amplitude (strength) of the k-th harmonic. The angle ∠cₖ gives its phase. Together they fully describe how much of each frequency is present and when it peaks."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Only odd harmonics",
            "explanation": "Half-wave symmetry means the signal is its own negative after half a period. This forces even harmonics to zero. Square waves and triangle waves have this symmetry, which is why they contain only odd harmonics."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Dirichlet conditions",
            "explanation": "Dirichlet conditions: x(t) is bounded, has finite discontinuities and extrema per period. Most practical signals satisfy these. At discontinuities, the series converges to the midpoint of the jump."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "x(t) = Σcₖe^(jkω₀t)",
            "explanation": "The exponential form x(t) = Σcₖe^(jkω₀t) uses complex exponentials at harmonic frequencies. The sum is from k = -∞ to +∞. This compact form is preferred for analysis because it leads to simpler derivations."

            "correctAnswer": "Discrete (line spectrum)",
            "explanation": "Periodic signals have discrete spectra—energy only at harmonic frequencies kω₀. Plotted as a 'line spectrum' with sticks at k = ...-2,-1,0,1,2... This contrasts with aperiodic signals which have continuous spectra."
