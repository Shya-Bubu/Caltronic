# Exam Focus: Fourier Series Introduction

## Essential Formulas

- Exponential FS: $x(t) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} c_k e^{jk\omega_0 t}$
- Fundamental: $\omega_0 = 2\pi/T = 2\pi f_0$
- Harmonics: $k\omega_0$ for integer k

## Key Concepts

- Sinusoids are eigenfunctions of LTI systems
- Square wave has only odd harmonics
- $|c_k|$ = amplitude, $\angle c_k$ = phase
- DC component = $c_0$ = average value

## Common Exam Tips

- Know square wave, triangle wave series by heart
- Relate symmetry to which harmonics appear
- Real signals: $c_{-k} = c_k^*$
