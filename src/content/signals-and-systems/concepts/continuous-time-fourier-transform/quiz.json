                "Discrete to continuous",
                "Analog to digital",
                "Complex to real"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Time to frequency domain",
            "explanation": "The Continuous-Time Fourier Transform converts time-domain signals x(t) to frequency-domain representations X(ω). It decomposes signals into sinusoidal components at all frequencies, not just harmonics."

            "correctAnswer": "∫x(t)e^(-jωt)dt",
            "explanation": "X(ω) = ∫x(t)e^(-jωt)dt integrates over all time from -∞ to +∞. The negative exponent is conventional. This extracts the component at frequency ω from the signal x(t)."

            "explanation": "F{δ(t)} = ∫δ(t)e^(-jωt)dt = e^0 = 1 for all ω. The impulse contains all frequencies equally—a flat spectrum. This is fundamental: testing with an impulse reveals complete frequency response."

            "explanation": "A constant (DC) has energy only at ω=0. F{1} = 2πδ(ω). The 2π factor comes from the inverse transform normalization. This is the dual of F{δ(t)}=1."

            "explanation": "F{rect(t/τ)} = τ·sinc(ωτ/2π). Rectangular pulse in time gives sinc in frequency. Narrower pulse = wider sinc. This time-frequency tradeoff is fundamental to signal analysis."

            "explanation": "Time shift property: delay by t₀ adds linear phase e^(-jωt₀). Magnitude |X(ω)| unchanged, only phase shifts. Higher frequencies shift more. Used to analyze propagation delays."

            "correctAnswer": "X·H",
            "explanation": "Convolution theorem: convolution in time = multiplication in frequency. X(ω)·H(ω) is much simpler than x(t)*h(t). This is the main reason we use Fourier analysis for LTI systems."

            "correctAnswer": "jωX",
            "explanation": "Differentiation property: d/dt ↔ jω. Higher frequencies amplified by factor ω, phase shifted 90°. This explains why derivatives emphasize high-frequency noise and sharp edges."

            "explanation": "Energy is same in both domains: total energy = ∫|x(t)|²dt = (1/2π)∫|X(ω)|²dω. |X(ω)|² is the energy spectral density. Energy is preserved between time and frequency representations."
