            "prompt": "A signal x(t) is periodic if:",
            "options": [
                "A) x(t) = x(t + mT₀) for some positive T₀ and all integers m",
                "B) x(t) has finite energy",

                "D) x(t) = 0 for t < 0"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "A",
            "explanation": "A periodic signal repeats itself every T₀ seconds. The condition x(t) = x(t + mT₀) for all integers m and some positive T₀ is the formal definition of periodicity. Periodic signals have infinite energy but finite average power."

                "D) 1/2 second"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "C",
            "explanation": "The first component has ω₁ = 6π → T₁ = 2π/6π = 1/3 s. The second has ω₂ = 10π → T₂ = 2π/10π = 1/5 s. The fundamental period is the LCM of 1/3 and 1/5, which is 1 second. This is the smallest T₀ for which both components complete an integer number of cycles."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "C",
            "explanation": "The fundamental frequency is the GCD of all component frequencies. GCD(4, 6) = 2 rad/s. Both 4 and 6 are integer multiples of 2 (4 = 2×2, 6 = 3×2), so the signal is periodic with ω₀ = 2 rad/s and fundamental period T₀ = 2π/2 = π seconds."

                "D) Energy signal with infinite power"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "B",
            "explanation": "Periodic signals repeat forever, so they have infinite energy. However, their average power over one period is finite. This classifies them as power signals. The power is P = (1/T₀)∫₀^T₀ |x(t)|² dt."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "B",
            "explanation": "From Euler's formula: e^{jθ} = cosθ + j·sinθ and e^{-jθ} = cosθ - j·sinθ. Subtracting: e^{jθ} - e^{-jθ} = 2j·sinθ. Therefore sinθ = (e^{jθ} - e^{-jθ})/(2j). This is one of the most used identities in Fourier analysis."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "B",
            "explanation": "X₀ = (1/T₀)∫_{T₀} x(t) dt, which is exactly the average (mean) value of the signal over one period. For example, x(t) = 11 + 4sin(5t) has X₀ = 11 because the sinusoidal component averages to zero."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "A",
            "explanation": "X₀ is the average value over one period. The cosine and sine terms average to zero over any complete number of cycles, leaving only the constant term. Therefore X₀ = 5. This is a quick exam shortcut: the DC component equals the constant offset."

            "correctAnswer": "B",
            "explanation": "For real signals, X_{-k} = X_k* (conjugate symmetry). Taking magnitudes: |X_{-k}| = |X_k*| = |X_k|. So the magnitude spectrum is always even symmetric about k = 0. This halves the information you need to specify."

            "correctAnswer": "C",
            "explanation": "The ratio ω₁/ω₂ = π/√2 is irrational. For a sum of sinusoids to be periodic, the ratio of their frequencies must be rational. Since π/√2 is irrational, no common period exists. The signal is aperiodic (non-periodic)."
