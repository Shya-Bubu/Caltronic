            ],
            "correctAnswer": "∫x(t)e^(-st)dt",
            "explanation": "The bilateral Laplace transform is X(s) = ∫x(t)e^(-st)dt from -∞ to +∞. For causal signals, the lower limit is 0. The variable s = σ+jω is complex, generalizing the Fourier transform."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "1",
            "explanation": "L{δ(t)} = ∫δ(t)e^(-st)dt = e^0 = 1. Same as Fourier transform. The impulse function transforms to a constant in both domains. Useful for finding system transfer functions."

            "explanation": "For causal (right-sided) signals, the ROC extends from the rightmost pole to +∞. For stability, this ROC must include the jω-axis. The ROC uniquely specifies causality."

            "correctAnswer": "s = -2, -3",
            "explanation": "Poles are roots of the denominator: s+2=0 gives s=-2, s+3=0 gives s=-3. Both poles are in LHP (left half-plane), indicating a stable system if causal."

            "explanation": "Integration in time = division by s: L{∫x(τ)dτ} = X(s)/s (assuming zero initial conditions). Integration adds a pole at s=0. Lowpass filtering effect."
