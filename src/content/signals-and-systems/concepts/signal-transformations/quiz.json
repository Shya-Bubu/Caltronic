            "options": [
                "Left shift by 3",
                "Right shift by 3",

                "Amplitude scaling"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Right shift by 3",
            "explanation": "Subtracting from the argument t-3 delays (right-shifts) the signal. Think of it as the signal 'waiting' 3 units before starting. Adding to the argument would advance (left-shift) the signal."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Compressed by 2",
            "explanation": "Multiplying the argument by 2 compresses the signal horizontally by factor 2. Events happen twice as fast. To compress by a, use x(at) where a>1. To stretch, use a<1."

            "id": "st-q3",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Time-reversed",
            "explanation": "Replacing t with -t reflects the signal about the vertical axis (t=0). Past becomes future and vice versa. This is called time reversal or folding. The signal plays backwards."

            "correctAnswer": "Scale then shift",
            "explanation": "Rewrite as x(2(t-2)). First scale by 2 (compress), then shift by 2 (not 4!). The order matters: scale-then-shift uses the shift value divided by the scale factor."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Amplitude inversion",
            "explanation": "Negating the entire function inverts the amplitude—positive values become negative and vice versa. This is reflection about the horizontal axis (t-axis). Not to be confused with time reversal x(-t)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "8s",
            "explanation": "Dividing t by 2 means x(t/2) = x(0.5t). With a<1, the signal stretches. Duration multiplies by 1/a = 2. The signal becomes slower and takes twice as long. Everything happens at half speed."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "x(-t) then shift right 3",
            "explanation": "Rewrite as x(-(t-3)). First reverse x(-t), then shift right by 3. Alternatively: shift left by 3 to get x(t+3), then reverse to get x(-t+3) = x(3-t). Both approaches work."

            "correctAnswer": "x(t) = x(-t)",
            "explanation": "Even signals are symmetric about t=0. Reflecting gives the same signal. Examples: cos(t), t², constants. Odd signals satisfy x(t) = -x(-t). Any signal can be decomposed into even and odd parts."

            "explanation": "x[-n] evaluates x at -n. For n≥0, we're looking at x at non-positive indices. If x[n]=0 for n<0 (causal), then x[-n]=0 for n>0. The signal is flipped about n=0."
