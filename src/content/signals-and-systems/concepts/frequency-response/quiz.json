            "prompt": "H(ω) = F{h(t)} is called the:",
            "options": [
                "Impulse response",
                "Frequency response",
                "Step response",
                "Transfer function"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Frequency response",
            "explanation": "The frequency response H(ω) is the Fourier transform of the impulse response h(t). It describes how the system modifies each frequency component. Every LTI system has a unique frequency response."
        },
        {
            "id": "fr-q2",
            "prompt": "If input is X(ω), output is:",
            "options": [
                "X(ω)+H(ω)",
                "X(ω)·H(ω)",
                "X(ω)/H(ω)",
                "X(ω)-H(ω)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "X(ω)·H(ω)",
            "explanation": "For LTI systems: Y(ω) = X(ω)·H(ω). Each frequency is scaled by H at that frequency. This is the frequency-domain equivalent of convolution y = x*h. Much simpler computation."
        },
        {

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Magnitude response",
            "explanation": "The magnitude response |H(ω)| shows how much the system amplifies or attenuates each frequency. Values |H|>1 mean gain, |H|<1 mean attenuation. Key for filter design."
        },
        {
            "id": "fr-q4",
            "prompt": "∠H(ω) is called the:",

            "correctAnswer": "Phase response",
            "explanation": "The phase response ∠H(ω) shows phase shift applied to each frequency. Linear phase means constant delay. Nonlinear phase causes dispersion—different frequencies arrive at different times."

            "id": "fr-q5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Low frequencies",
            "explanation": "Low-pass filters pass low frequencies (|H|≈1) and attenuate high frequencies (|H|→0). Applications: smoothing, noise reduction, anti-aliasing before sampling. Most practical signals need low-pass filtering."

            "correctAnswer": "High frequencies",
            "explanation": "High-pass filters block DC and low frequencies while passing high frequencies. Applications: removing DC offset, edge detection, AC coupling. The dual of low-pass filtering."

            "id": "fr-q7",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "1/√2 (≈ 0.707)",
            "explanation": "Cutoff frequency is the -3dB point where |H| = 1/√2 ≈ 0.707. Power is halved at this frequency. This is the conventional boundary between passband and stopband for analog filters."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Range where |H| > 0.707",
            "explanation": "Bandwidth is usually measured as the frequency range where |H| ≥ 1/√2 (within 3dB of peak). For low-pass: BW = ωc. For bandpass: BW = ω₂-ω₁. Wider BW means faster potential response."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Specific range ω₁ to ω₂",
            "explanation": "Bandpass filters pass frequencies in a specific band [ω₁,ω₂] and attenuate outside. Applications: radio tuning, voice extraction, frequency selection. Center frequency = (ω₁+ω₂)/2."

            "correctAnswer": "-dφ/dω",
            "explanation": "Group delay τg = -dφ/dω is the negative derivative of phase. It measures the delay of the signal envelope at each frequency. Constant group delay means no dispersion—signal shape preserved."
