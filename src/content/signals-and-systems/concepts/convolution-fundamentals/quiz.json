            ],
            "correctAnswer": "∫x(τ)h(t-τ)dτ",
            "explanation": "Convolution y(t) = ∫x(τ)h(t-τ)dτ integrates the product of input x and flipped-shifted impulse response h over all τ. This computes how the system responds to each infinitesimal piece of the input signal."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "x(t)",
            "explanation": "The delta function is the identity for convolution. Convolving any signal with δ(t) returns the original signal unchanged. This is why δ(t) is called the identity element. The impulse 'samples' every point of x(t)."

            "correctAnswer": "x(t-T)",
            "explanation": "Convolving with a shifted impulse δ(t-T) delays the signal by T. This is the sifting property in action. The shifted impulse acts as a delay line, shifting the entire signal by T time units."

            "correctAnswer": "Time-reversed then shifted",
            "explanation": "To compute h(t-τ), first reflect h(τ) about τ=0 to get h(-τ), then shift right by t. As t increases, we slide this flipped version across x(τ) and compute the overlap integral at each t."

            "correctAnswer": "Both commutative and associative",
            "explanation": "x*h = h*x (commutative) and (x*h)*g = x*(h*g) (associative). Commutativity means we can flip either function. Associativity lets us combine cascaded systems in any order."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "5",
            "explanation": "Duration of convolution = sum of individual durations. If x spans [0,2] and h spans [0,3], then x*h spans [0,5]. This makes intuitive sense: the output starts when input first hits the system and ends when the last bit of input clears."

            "correctAnswer": "Flipping one signal",
            "explanation": "Step 1: Choose one signal (usually h) and flip it horizontally. Step 2: Slide the flipped signal across the other. Step 3: At each position t, multiply overlapping portions and integrate. The flip is essential to the convolution operation."

            "explanation": "The sum is over the dummy variable k from -∞ to +∞ (or the support of the signals). At each output sample n, we sum up products of x[k] and the shifted h[n-k]. The variable n identifies which output sample we're computing."

            "explanation": "Impulse convolved with impulse gives impulse. Using the sifting property: δ[n]*δ[n] = Σδ[k]δ[n-k]. This only has a nonzero term when k=0 and n-k=0, so n=0. Result is δ[n]."

            "correctAnswer": "Complete system behavior for any input",
            "explanation": "The impulse response h(t) completely characterizes an LTI system. Once we know h(t), we can find the output for ANY input using convolution. This is the power of LTI system theory and why impulse response is so important."
