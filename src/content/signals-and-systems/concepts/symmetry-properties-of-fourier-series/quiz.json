            "correctAnswer": "C",
            "explanation": "Real signals have conjugate symmetry: X_{−k} = X_k*. This means the real part of X_k is even and the imaginary part is odd. The magnitude is even (|X_{−k}| = |X_k|) and the phase is odd (∠X_{−k} = −∠X_k)."

            "correctAnswer": "B",
            "explanation": "Real: X_{−k} = X_k*. Even: X_{−k} = X_k. Combining: X_k* = X_k, so X_k is real. Also X_k = X_{−k}, so X_k is an even function of k. The square pulse (centred) is a perfect example."

            "explanation": "From X_{−k} = X_k*: |X_{−k}| = |X_k*| = |X_k|. The magnitude spectrum is always even symmetric for real signals. You only need to plot the positive-k half."
