            "options": [
                "Infinite energy",
                "Finite total energy",
                "Finite average power",
                "Zero energy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Finite total energy",
            "explanation": "Energy signals have finite total energy E = âˆ«|x(t)|Â²dt < âˆž. They 'run out' eventually. Examples include pulses and decaying exponentials that don't extend forever."

                "Energy signal",

                "Both",
                "Neither"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Power signal",
            "explanation": "Sinusoids extend infinitely in time, giving infinite total energy. But their average power P = AÂ²/2 is finite. Infinite energy + finite power = power signal."

        {
            "id": "q3",

            "correctAnswer": "18",
            "explanation": "For a sinusoid x(t) = Acos(Ï‰t), average power P = AÂ²/2. Here A = 6, so P = 36/2 = 18. This is a fundamental formula to memorize."

            "correctAnswer": "Zero",
            "explanation": "Finite energy spread over infinite time gives zero average power: P = lim(E/T) as Tâ†’âˆž = 0. This is why energy and power signals are mutually exclusive."

            "explanation": "Energy E = âˆ«|x(t)|Â²dt over all time. We use magnitude squared to handle complex signals and ensure non-negative energy. Not just x(t), not time-averaged."

            "explanation": "E = âˆ«|x(t)|Â²dt = âˆ«AÂ²dt from -T to T = AÂ² Ã— 2T = 2AÂ²T. Area under the squared amplitude for the pulse duration."

            "correctAnswer": "25",
            "explanation": "For a constant signal x(t) = A, power P = AÂ². No division by 2 like sinusoids because the signal is constant, not oscillating. P = 5Â² = 25."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "No, never",
            "explanation": "Energy and power classifications are mutually exclusive. If E is finite, P = 0 (energy signal). If P is finite, E = âˆž (power signal). No signal can be both."

            "correctAnswer": "Energy signal",
            "explanation": "The decaying exponential has E = âˆ«e^(-2t)dt from 0 to âˆž = 1/2, which is finite. Finite energy means it's an energy signal, not a power signal."

        {
            "id": "q10",
            "prompt": "Why use |x(t)|Â² instead of x(t)Â² in energy formulas?",

            "correctAnswer": "To handle complex signals",
            "explanation": "For complex-valued signals, |x|Â² = x Ã— x* ensures the result is always real and non-negative. For real signals, |x|Â² = xÂ², so it reduces to the same thing."
