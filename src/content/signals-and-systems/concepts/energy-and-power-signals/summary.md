# Summary: Energy and Power Signals

**If you remember only this, remember these:**

1. **Energy signal**: Finite total energy, zero average power (e.g., pulses)
2. **Power signal**: Finite average power, infinite energy (e.g., sinusoids)
3. Energy: $E = \int |x(t)|^2 dt$
4. Power: $P = \lim \frac{1}{2T} \int |x(t)|^2 dt$
5. A signal is either energy OR power, **never both**

> **Why This Matters**
> This classification determines analysis methods, filter response behavior, and system design.
> Communication systems treat data bursts (energy) differently from carriers (power).
