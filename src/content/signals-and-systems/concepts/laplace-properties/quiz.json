            "id": "lp-q1",
            "prompt": "Time shifting x(t-T)u(t-T) becomes:",
            "options": [
                "X(s-T)",
                "e^(-sT)X(s)",

                "X(s)/T"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "e^(-sT)X(s)",
            "explanation": "Time delay by T multiplies the transform by e^(-sT). This exponential factor represents the phase shift that occurs when a signal is delayed. The magnitude |e^(-sT)| = 1, so only phase changes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "X(s-a)",
            "explanation": "Multiplying by e^(at) in time shifts the transform by a to the right: X(s) → X(s-a). All poles and zeros shift right by a. This is dual to time shifting."

            "explanation": "Differentiation multiplies by s and subtracts the initial condition: L{x'} = sX(s) - x(0-) = sX(s) - 3. The initial condition accounts for any energy stored before t=0."

            "explanation": "Integration divides by s: L{∫x dt} = X(s)/s. This adds a pole at s=0. Integration is the inverse operation of differentiation, so division vs multiplication by s."

            "explanation": "Convolution in time = multiplication in s-domain. This is the convolution theorem and why transfer functions are so useful: Y(s) = H(s)X(s). Simple multiplication instead of integration."

            "explanation": "Initial value theorem: x(0+) = lim(s→∞) of sX(s). This extracts the initial jump by looking at high-frequency (short-time) behavior. Works for all proper rational X(s)."

            "explanation": "Final value theorem only works if the limit exists. sX(s) must have all poles in LHP (except possibly at s=0). RHP poles mean the system is unstable and has no finite final value."

            "explanation": "Multiplication by t corresponds to negative differentiation with respect to s: L{tx(t)} = -dX(s)/ds. This is useful for finding transforms of t·e^(-at), t·sin(ωt), etc."

            "explanation": "Start with L{cos(3t)u(t)} = s/(s²+9). The e^(-2t) factor shifts s→s+2: X(s) = (s+2)/((s+2)²+9). Frequency shift handles exponential multipliers."
