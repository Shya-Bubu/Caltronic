            ],
            "correctAnswer": "aX+bY",
            "explanation": "Linearity: F{ax(t)+by(t)} = aX(ω)+bY(ω). Scaling and addition pass through unchanged. This is the foundation property that makes Fourier analysis useful for superposition."

                "X(-ω)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "X(-ω)",
            "explanation": "Time reversal flips the spectrum: F{x(-t)} = X(-ω). Playing a signal backwards reverses its frequency characteristics. For real signals, this means conjugation since X(-ω) = X*(ω)."

            "correctAnswer": "Expand",
            "explanation": "F{x(at)} = (1/|a|)X(ω/a). Compressing time (a>1) expands frequency by 1/a. Fast signals have wide bandwidth. This is the uncertainty principle: you can't have narrow time AND narrow frequency."

            "correctAnswer": "2πx(-ω)",
            "explanation": "Duality property: swapping roles of t and ω gives F{X(t)} = 2πx(-ω). This lets us find new transform pairs from known ones. The 2π factor comes from the synthesis integral."

            "explanation": "Real-even signals have real-even transforms. The integral of (even)×cos(ωt) is real; the integral of (even)×sin(ωt) is zero. No imaginary part. Symmetric x means symmetric X."

            "correctAnswer": "X/jω + πX(0)δ(ω)",
            "explanation": "Integration divides by jω but needs DC handling: F{∫x} = X(ω)/(jω) + πX(0)δ(ω). The delta term accounts for any DC in the integral. Low frequencies are amplified."

            "explanation": "From the inverse Fourier transform at t=0: x(0) = (1/2π)∫X(ω)dω. All frequency components add up at t=0. This connects time-domain value to total area under the spectrum."

            "explanation": "At ω=0, X(0) = ∫x(t)·1·dt = ∫x(t)dt. The DC component equals the total area (net integral) of the signal. Zero-mean signals have X(0)=0."
