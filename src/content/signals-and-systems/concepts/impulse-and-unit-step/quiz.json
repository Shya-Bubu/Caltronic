            ],
            "correctAnswer": "9",
            "explanation": "Using the sifting property, the integral of f(t)×δ(t-t₀) equals f(t₀) when t₀ is in the integration interval. Here f(t)=t², t₀=3 is in [-2,5], so the answer is 3²=9."

                "The derivative of a ramp function"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "A distribution with area 1 concentrated at t=0",
            "explanation": "δ(t) is technically a distribution (generalized function), not a classical function. It's defined by its behavior under integration: zero everywhere except at t=0, but with total area exactly 1."

            "correctAnswer": "δ(t) = du/dt",
            "explanation": "The impulse function is the derivative of the unit step: δ(t) = du/dt. Conversely, integrating δ(t) from -∞ to t gives u(t)."

            "correctAnswer": "δ(t)/3",
            "explanation": "The scaling property states δ(at) = δ(t)/|a|. This is NOT the same as multiplying by 'a'. For δ(3t), we get δ(t)/3. Common mistake: thinking it's 3δ(t)!"

            "explanation": "The impulse response of an RC circuit is h(t) = (1/RC)×exp(-t/RC)×u(t), which is an exponential decay. The impulse instantaneously charges the capacitor, which then discharges through the resistor."

            "explanation": "Using sifting: f(1/4) where f(t)=sin(2πt). So sin(2π×1/4) = sin(π/2) = 1."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "δ(t) can be measured directly in practice",
            "explanation": "δ(t) is an idealization that cannot be measured directly. In practice, we approximate it with very short, high-amplitude pulses, but a true delta function is a mathematical abstraction."
