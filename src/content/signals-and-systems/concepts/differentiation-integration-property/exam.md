## 📝 Exam Focus: Differentiation and Integration Property

### What Examiners Are Looking For

This property is tested in two ways: (1) direct application, and (2) as a tool to derive FS of complex waveforms. The professor explicitly warns that if the question says "use properties", you must use properties — not the definition integral.

### Common Question Types

**Type 1: Derive FS using differentiation property**
"Using the differentiation property, find the FS coefficients of the triangular pulse train."
→ Differentiate to get a simpler signal, find its FS, divide by jkω₀.

**Type 2: Interpret sharpening/smoothing**
"Explain what happens to the frequency content when a signal is differentiated."
→ High frequency components are amplified (highpass/sharpening).

**Type 3: Integration as lowpass**
"A square pulse is integrated. Describe the effect on its spectrum."
→ High harmonics attenuated → smoother signal (triangle-like).

### Exam Tips

1. Always find X₀ separately — the differentiation property is only for k ≠ 0
2. When differentiating signals with jumps, include delta functions at the discontinuities
3. If asked to "use properties", do NOT use the integral definition — you'll lose marks
4. Remember: diff = highpass = sharpening; integration = lowpass = smoothing

### Marks Distribution (Typical)
- Identifying the right property: 2 marks
- Correct differentiation of the signal: 3–4 marks
- Using impulse train FS pair: 2 marks
- Final XK expression via division: 2–3 marks
