# Summary: Deterministic vs Random Signals

**If you remember only this, remember these:**

1. **Deterministic** — exact value known from formula, probability = 1
2. **Random** — values follow probability distribution, only statistics known
3. Real signals = deterministic component + random noise
4. **SNR** = Signal Power / Noise Power (higher is better)
5. We study deterministic first, then add probability theory for random

> **Why This Matters**
> Every communication, control, and sensing system deals with noise.
> Understanding randomness is essential for detection, estimation, and filtering.
