            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Exact values from a mathematical formula",
            "explanation": "Deterministic signals have exact values that can be calculated from an explicit mathematical formula for any time t. If you know the formula, you know every value with probability 1."

            "correctAnswer": "Thermal noise",
            "explanation": "Thermal noise is inherently randomâ€”caused by random electron motion, it has no formula and can only be described statistically. The others are all deterministic with explicit formulas."

            "explanation": "Converting from dB: SNR = 10^(dB/10) = 10^(20/10) = 10^2 = 100. A 20 dB SNR means the signal power is 100 times the noise power."
