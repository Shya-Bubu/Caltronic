                "Input to output in s-domain",
                "Poles to zeros",
                "Time to frequency",
                "Initial to final values"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Input to output in s-domain",
            "explanation": "H(s) = Y(s)/X(s) is the ratio of output to input Laplace transforms (with zero ICs). It completely characterizes an LTI system. All system properties can be derived from H(s)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "1/(s²+3s+2)",
            "explanation": "Taking Laplace: (s²+3s+2)Y(s) = X(s). Thus H(s) = Y/X = 1/(s²+3s+2). The denominator is the characteristic polynomial. Poles at s=-1,-2 (both in LHP, so stable)."

            "correctAnswer": "Denominator",
            "explanation": "Poles are where H(s)→∞, i.e., denominator = 0. They determine stability, transient behavior, and natural frequencies. All poles in LHP means stable. Poles are the most important feature of H(s)."

            "explanation": "Zeros are where H(s)=0, i.e., numerator = 0. At these frequencies, output is zero regardless of input. Zeros shape the frequency response but don't directly affect stability."

            "explanation": "Order = highest power of s in denominator = number of poles. First-order has one pole, giving exponential response. Second-order (2 poles) can have oscillation. Order indicates system complexity."

            "correctAnswer": "s = -5",
            "explanation": "Setting denominator s+5=0 gives pole at s=-5. In the LHP, so stable. Time constant τ = 1/5 = 0.2s. Impulse response h(t) = e^(-5t)u(t), which decays with that time constant."

            "correctAnswer": "H₁·H₂",
            "explanation": "Cascading systems multiplies their transfer functions: H = H₁·H₂. In time domain, this means convolving impulse responses. Multiplication is much easier than convolution."

            "correctAnswer": "H(0)",
            "explanation": "DC gain = H(0) = output/input for DC (constant) input. At s=0 (ω=0), we're evaluating the transfer function at zero frequency. Important for steady-state analysis."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "s = jω",
            "explanation": "H(jω) = H(s)|ₛ₌ⱼω is the frequency response. Setting s = jω restricts to the imaginary axis. This works because Fourier transform is Laplace on jω-axis. H(jω) gives magnitude and phase vs frequency."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Re(s) < 0",
            "explanation": "All poles must be in the left half-plane (LHP) for BIBO stability. Re(s) < 0 means negative real parts. Poles on or right of jω-axis cause unbounded or sustained responses."
