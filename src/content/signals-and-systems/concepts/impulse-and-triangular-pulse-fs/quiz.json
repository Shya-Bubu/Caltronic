        {
            "id": "q1",

            "options": [
                "A) X_k = 1/T₀ for all k",
                "B) X_k = T₀ for all k",
                "C) X_k = sin(kω₀T₀)/(kπ)",
                "D) X_k = 1/k"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "A) X_k = 1/T₀ for all k",
            "explanation": "Using the sifting property of δ(t): X_k = (1/T₀)∫δ(t)e^{−jkω₀t}dt = (1/T₀)·e⁰ = 1/T₀ for ALL k. Every harmonic has the same weight — the delta function has infinite bandwidth."

            "id": "q2",
            "prompt": "Why are all FS coefficients of the impulse train equal (no decay)?",
            "options": [
                "A) Because it's a real function",
                "B) Because the delta function is the sharpest possible signal with infinite bandwidth",
                "C) Because it's periodic",
                "D) Because T₀ is very large"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "B) Because the delta function is the sharpest possible signal with infinite bandwidth",
            "explanation": "The delta function has zero width and infinite sharpness. Creating such a sharp feature requires all frequency components equally — the high harmonics never diminish. This is infinite bandwidth."

                "D) Use time reversal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "C) Find X₀ separately, then differentiate x(t)",
            "explanation": "Always find X₀ first (it needs no properties). Then differentiate x(t) to get a simpler signal whose FS is easy to find. The differentiation property (valid for k≠0) then lets you recover X_k by dividing by jkω₀."

                "A) Only constant segments",
                "B) Constant segments plus delta functions at discontinuities",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "B) Constant segments plus delta functions at discontinuities",
            "explanation": "Between jump points, the derivative is the constant slope of the ramp. At the discontinuities (where the triangle drops), finite jumps produce delta functions. Both parts must be accounted for."

            "correctAnswer": "B) 1/k² (faster than square pulse)",
            "explanation": "The triangular pulse is smoother than the square pulse (ramps instead of jumps). Smoother signals have faster-decaying coefficients. Applying the differentiation property: X_k = X'_k/(jkω₀), where X'_k decays as 1/k (impulse-like), adds another 1/k factor → total 1/k²."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "C) Purely real and even",
            "explanation": "The impulse train is real and even (δ(t) = δ(−t)). Real + even signals have purely real, even FS coefficients. Indeed, X_k = 1/T₀ is a positive real constant for all k ✓"

            "id": "q7",

                "A) It's the only valid window",
                "B) It conveniently captures exactly one delta function δ(t) at t = 0",
                "C) The integral is easier with negative limits",
                "D) It makes X₀ zero"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "B) It conveniently captures exactly one delta function δ(t) at t = 0",
            "explanation": "This window is centred at t = 0, so only δ(t) at the origin falls inside. This simplifies the integral enormously — you apply the sifting property once and get 1/T₀ immediately."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "C) Triangular pulse (∝ 1/k²)",
            "explanation": "Smoother signals → faster decay. Triangle (ramps, smooth) decays as 1/k²; square (sharp edges) decays as 1/k; impulse (infinitely sharp) doesn't decay at all. The pattern: smoother signal = fewer high-frequency components needed."

            "explanation": "X_k = X'_k/(jkω₀) = (−1/2)/(jkπ). Simplifying: −1/(2jkπ) = j/(2kπ) (using −1/j = j). This matches the lecture derivation."

            "correctAnswer": "B) Differentiation reduces signal complexity, and dividing by jkω₀ is trivial",
            "explanation": "Differentiating converts ramps into constants and jumps into delta functions — much simpler signals whose FS is known. Then one division by jkω₀ recovers the original FS. This avoids tedious integration by parts. Note: X₀ still needs to be computed separately."
