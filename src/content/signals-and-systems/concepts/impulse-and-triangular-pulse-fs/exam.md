## 📝 Exam Focus: Impulse Train and Triangular Pulse FS

### What Examiners Are Looking For

You must know the impulse train FS by heart and be able to derive the triangular pulse FS using the differentiation property. Questions often require you to "use properties" — don't use the integral.

### Common Question Types

**Type 1: FS of impulse train**
"Find X_k for the impulse train with period T₀."
→ X_k = 1/T₀ for all k. Justify using delta sifting property.

**Type 2: Triangular pulse via differentiation**
"Using the differentiation property, find the FS of the triangular waveform."
→ Differentiate → constant + delta train → find X'_k → divide by jkω₀.

**Type 3: Rate of decay interpretation**
"Compare the rate of coefficient decay for square, triangular, and impulse trains."
→ Square: 1/k; Triangle: 1/k²; Impulse: no decay. Smoother → faster decay.

### Exam Tips

1. Know the impulse train FS cold — it's used in many derivations
2. Always find X₀ separately before using differentiation property
3. When differentiating, account for delta functions at discontinuities
4. State that the differentiation property is for k ≠ 0

### Marks Distribution (Typical)
- X₀ calculation: 2 marks
- Differentiation of signal (including deltas): 3–4 marks
- Applying impulse train FS pair: 2 marks
- Dividing by jkω₀ for final answer: 2 marks
