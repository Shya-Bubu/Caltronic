            "options": [
                "Time to peak",
                "10% to 90% of final value",
                "Time to settle",
                "Initial slope"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "10% to 90% of final value",
            "explanation": "Rise time tr is the time for the response to go from 10% to 90% of the final steady-state value. It indicates how fast the system responds to inputs."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Underdamped",
            "explanation": "ζ < 1 means underdamped. The response will oscillate and overshoot before settling. ζ = 0.5 gives about 16% overshoot. Common in responsive control systems."

            "correctAnswer": "No overshoot, fastest settling",
            "explanation": "ζ = 1 is the boundary between oscillatory and non-oscillatory. It reaches final value quickest without overshooting. Ideal for systems where overshoot is unacceptable."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Faster ωd = earlier peak",
            "explanation": "Higher damped frequency ωd means shorter period and earlier peak. tp inversely proportional to ωd. Fast oscillation = quick first peak."

            "explanation": "Using Mp = exp(-πζ/√(1-ζ²)) = 0.05, solving gives ζ ≈ 0.69. ζ = 0.7 is often used as a design target for good balance of speed and overshoot."
