# Exam Focus

## Key Formulas
- Peak time: tp = π/ωd
- Overshoot: Mp = exp(-πζ/√(1-ζ²))
- Settling time (2%): ts ≈ 4/σ = 4/(ζωn)
- Rise time: tr ≈ 1.8/ωn

## Common Tasks
1. Calculate ζ and ωn from given overshoot
2. Find settling time from pole locations
3. Sketch step response from transfer function
4. Design for specified time-domain criteria
