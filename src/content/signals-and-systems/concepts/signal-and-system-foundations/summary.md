# Summary: Signal and System Foundations

**If you remember only this, remember these:**

1. A **signal** is any physical quantity that varies with time (or space)
2. A **system** transforms input signals into output signals
3. Notation: $x(t)$ for continuous-time, $x[n]$ for discrete-time
4. **Transducers** convert between signal types (e.g., sound → voltage)
5. The input-output model $x(t) \to \mathcal{T} \to y(t)$ describes all systems

> **Why This Matters**
> This vocabulary is the foundation for ALL electrical engineering.
> Every topic — circuits, control, communications, DSP — uses this framework.
> Master it now; use it forever.
