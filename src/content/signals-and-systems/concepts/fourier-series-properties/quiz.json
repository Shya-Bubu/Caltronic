            "options": [
                "Adding t₀",
                "Multiplying by e^(-jkω₀t₀)",
                "No change",
                "Multiplying by t₀"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Multiplying by e^(-jkω₀t₀)",
            "explanation": "Time shift property: x(t-t₀) has coefficients cₖe^(-jkω₀t₀). Only phase changes—magnitude |cₖ| remains same. This shows time delay equals linear phase shift in frequency domain."
        },

                "Divide by jkω₀",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Multiply by jkω₀",
            "explanation": "Differentiation property: if x↔cₖ, then dx/dt↔jkω₀cₖ. Each harmonic is multiplied by jkω₀. This amplifies high frequencies and adds 90° phase shift. Useful for analyzing derivative relationships."

            "explanation": "Integration property: ∫x dt has coefficients cₖ/(jkω₀) for k≠0. Division attenuates high frequencies and shifts phase by -90°. The k=0 case needs special handling (adds to DC)."

            "explanation": "Parseval: (1/T)∫|x(t)|²dt = Σ|cₖ|². Average power equals sum of harmonic powers. Energy is conserved between domains. This lets us calculate power without time integration."

            "correctAnswer": "2cₖ",
            "explanation": "Linearity: 2x(t)↔2cₖ. Scaling the signal scales all coefficients equally. The harmonic structure (relative magnitudes) stays the same, just the overall amplitude changes."

            "explanation": "Linearity: adding signals adds their coefficients. x+y↔cₖˣ+cₖʸ. This is superposition: each frequency component adds independently. Foundation for analyzing composite signals."

            "explanation": "Time scaling: if x(t) has period T, then x(at) has period T/|a|. Fundamental frequency becomes ω₀' = |a|ω₀. Compressing time expands frequency and vice versa."

            "explanation": "Convolution property: if x*y, coefficients multiply: cₖ^(x*y) = T·cₖˣ·cₖʸ. This is analogous to the convolution theorem for Fourier transforms. Time convolution = frequency multiplication."
