            "options": [
                "A) The same amplitude",
                "B) The same fundamental frequency ω₀",
                "C) The same phase",
                "D) Zero DC component"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "B",
            "explanation": "Linearity says αX_k + βY_k only when x(t) and y(t) share the same ω₀. If they have different fundamental frequencies, the harmonic grids don't align and you cannot simply add coefficients at the same index k."

            "prompt": "If x(t) has FS coefficients X_k, the coefficients of x(t − t₀) are:",

                "A) X_k · e^{jkω₀t₀}",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "B",
            "explanation": "Time shifting introduces a linear phase factor: x(t − t₀) ↔ X_k e^{−jkω₀t₀}. The minus sign in the exponent is critical. This phase factor has magnitude 1, so |X_k| is unchanged."

            "correctAnswer": "B",
            "explanation": "The time shift factor e^{−jkω₀t₀} has |e^{−jkω₀t₀}| = 1, so multiplying X_k by it doesn't change the magnitude. Only the phase changes: ∠X_k' = ∠X_k − kω₀t₀. This is a key physical insight."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "B",
            "explanation": "Time reversal mirrors the index: x(−t) ↔ X_{−k}. Replacing t with −t in the synthesis equation and substituting m = −k gives the result. For real signals, X_{−k} = X_k*, so time reversal also gives the conjugate."

            "correctAnswer": "C",
            "explanation": "Time scaling by α = 2 compresses the signal: period becomes T₀/2, fundamental frequency becomes 2ω₀. But the FS coefficients X_k remain unchanged. The same magnitudes and phases, just on a faster time scale."

            "correctAnswer": "C",
            "explanation": "The phase shift is −kω₀t₀ = −k(2π/T₀)(T₀/4) = −kπ/2. So k=1 gets −π/2, k=2 gets −π, k=3 gets −3π/2, etc. The phase change is proportional to k — higher harmonics shift more."

                "A) Higher harmonics have larger amplitude",
                "B) Higher harmonics oscillate faster, so the same time shift represents more cycles",
                "C) Higher harmonics are always imaginary",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "B",
            "explanation": "A time shift of t₀ seconds represents t₀/T_k cycles for the k-th harmonic (where T_k = T₀/k). Higher k means shorter period T_k, so the same t₀ covers more cycles → larger phase change. The phase shift is −kω₀t₀, linearly proportional to k."

            "correctAnswer": "A",
            "explanation": "By linearity: x(t) = αp(t) + βq(t) → X_k = αP_k + βQ_k = 3P_k + 2Q_k. This works because both signals share the same ω₀."

            "correctAnswer": "B",
            "explanation": "For real signals: X_{−k} = X_k*. So x(−t) ↔ X_{−k} = X_k*. The FS of the time-reversed signal is the complex conjugate of the original FS. This means magnitudes are identical but phases are negated."
