            "options": [
                "Increases",
                "Decreases",
                "Unchanged",
                "Depends on k"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Unchanged",
            "explanation": "Time shifting only affects phase, not magnitude. The new coefficient is Xk·e^(-jkω₀t₀), which has |e^(-jkω₀t₀)| = 1, so |Yk| = |Xk|."

                "Cannot determine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "X₋₃ depends on the signal",
            "explanation": "Time reversal gives Y₃ = X₋₃. We're told X₃ = 2j, but we need X₋₃ for x(t) to find the coefficient for x(-t) at k=3. Unless given X₋₃, we cannot determine it."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Same fundamental frequency ω₀",
            "explanation": "Linearity requires both signals to share the same ω₀. Otherwise, harmonics don't align and coefficients can't be simply added."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "20 rad/s",
            "explanation": "Time scaling by α changes ω₀ to αω₀. With α = 2 and original ω₀ = 10, new fundamental is 2 × 10 = 20 rad/s."

            "correctAnswer": "3 - 2j",
            "explanation": "Conjugate symmetry for real signals: X₋k = Xk*. So X₋₅ = (3 + 2j)* = 3 - 2j."

            "correctAnswer": "-kω₀t₀ (varies with k)",
            "explanation": "The phase change is -kω₀t₀, meaning higher harmonics (larger k) experience larger phase shifts for the same time delay."

            "correctAnswer": "Expand",
            "explanation": "Time-frequency duality: compressing in time expands in frequency. The new ω₀ = αω₀ > ω₀, so harmonic spacing increases."
