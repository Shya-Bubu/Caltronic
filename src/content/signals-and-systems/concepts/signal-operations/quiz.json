            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Shift right by 3",
            "explanation": "x(t-t0) with positive t0 shifts the signal RIGHT by t0 units. So x(t-3) delays the signal by 3 time units.",

            "explanation": "x(at) with |a|<1 expands the signal. x(t/2) = x(0.5t) expands by factor 2, so duration becomes 2T.",
