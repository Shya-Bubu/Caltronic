# Exam Strategies: Signal Operations

## Time Shifting Questions
**Pattern**: Given x(t), sketch x(t-2) or x(2t+1)

**Strategy**: 
1. Identify the transformation type
2. For x(t-t0): shift RIGHT by t0
3. For x(at+b): rewrite as x(a(t + b/a)), then scale then shift

## Common Traps
- Forgetting that x(t-2) shifts RIGHT, not left
- Getting order wrong in combined transformations
