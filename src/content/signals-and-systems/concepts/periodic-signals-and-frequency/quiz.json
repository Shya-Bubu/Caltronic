        {
            "id": "q1",
            "prompt": "What is the fundamental period T₀ of x(t) = sin(10t)?",
            "options": [
                "10 s",
                "2π/10 s",
                "10/2π s",
                "1/10 s"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "2π/10 s",
            "explanation": "For sin(ωt), the period is T = 2π/ω. Here ω = 10 rad/s, so T₀ = 2π/10 = π/5 ≈ 0.628 s. The answer '10 s' confuses ω with T. The answer '1/10 s' would be correct if 10 were frequency in Hz, not rad/s."

            "id": "q2",
            "prompt": "If f₀ = 50 Hz, what is ω₀?",

                "50π rad/s",
                "25 rad/s"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "100π rad/s",
            "explanation": "Angular frequency ω₀ = 2πf₀ = 2π × 50 = 100π rad/s ≈ 314.16 rad/s. A common mistake is forgetting the 2π factor."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3",
            "prompt": "Is x(t) = cos(t) + cos(√2 t) periodic?",
            "options": [
                "Yes, with period 2π",
                "Yes, with period 2π√2",
                "No, because frequencies are incommensurate",
                "Yes, with period π"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "No, because frequencies are incommensurate",
            "explanation": "For a sum to be periodic, the ratio of periods must be rational. T₁/T₂ = 2π/(2π/√2) = √2, which is irrational. Therefore x(t) is not periodic."
        },
        {

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "6 rad/s",
            "explanation": "The fundamental frequency is the GCD of all non-zero frequencies. GCD(6, 18) = 6 rad/s. The DC component (5) has zero frequency and doesn't affect ω₀."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "50",
            "explanation": "The number of cycles per second is the frequency: f₀ = 1/T₀ = 1/0.02 = 50 Hz. So 50 complete cycles occur in 1 second."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Unit step u(t)",
            "explanation": "Periodic signals (sin, cos, square wave) are power signals with finite average power. The unit step u(t) is neither power nor energy—it has infinite energy and non-zero average, but doesn't fit the power signal definition since power → 0.5 as T→∞."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "3 times larger",
            "explanation": "The kth harmonic has frequency k × ω₀. So the 3rd harmonic has frequency 3ω₀, which is 3 times the fundamental frequency."

            "id": "q8",

                "4T₀"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "T₀",
            "explanation": "Adding identical signals: 2x(t) still has the same period T₀. Scaling amplitude doesn't change the period. The period would only change if we time-scaled the signal."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "11",
            "explanation": "The DC component is the constant term that doesn't vary with time. Here it's 11. The sin and cos terms have zero average over a complete period."

            "id": "q10",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "π",
            "explanation": "T₁ = 2π/4 = π/2, T₂ = 2π/6 = π/3. The fundamental period is LCM(π/2, π/3) = π. In one period π, the first component completes 2 cycles and the second completes 3 cycles."
