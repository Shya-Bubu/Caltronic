            ],
            "correctAnswer": "S₂(S₁(x))",
            "explanation": "In cascade connection, the output of S₁ becomes the input to S₂. So the overall transformation is S₂(S₁(x)), where S₁ processes first and S₂ processes second."

            "correctAnswer": "S₁(x) + S₂(x)",
            "explanation": "In parallel connection, both systems receive the same input and their outputs are summed. The overall output is y = S₁(x) + S₂(x)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "The output is fed back to influence the input",
            "explanation": "Feedback is defined by the output being fed back and combined with the input (usually subtracted to create an error signal). This creates a closed loop that can self-correct."

            "correctAnswer": "The difference between desired and actual output",
            "explanation": "In negative feedback, e = r - y where r is the reference (desired) and y is the actual output. The error signal drives the system to minimize the difference."

            "correctAnswer": "H₁(s) × H₂(s)",
            "explanation": "In cascade/series connection, transfer functions multiply. If Y = H₂(H₁·X), then Y/X = H₁·H₂. This is because the output of one becomes the input to the next."

            "correctAnswer": "G(s)/(1 + G(s))",
            "explanation": "For unity negative feedback, the closed-loop transfer function is T(s) = G(s)/(1 + G(s)). This is derived from Y = G(R - Y), solving for Y/R."

            "correctAnswer": "Ability to reject disturbances and reduce sensitivity to parameter changes",
            "explanation": "Feedback's key advantage is robustness: it can reject disturbances and reduce sensitivity to plant parameter variations. This comes at the cost of potential instability if not designed properly."

            "correctAnswer": "G/(1 + GH)",
            "explanation": "For negative feedback with forward G and feedback H: T = G/(1 + GH). If H = 1 (unity feedback), this simplifies to G/(1 + G)."

            "explanation": "A thermostat measures actual temperature (output), compares it to desired temperature (reference), and adjusts heating/cooling based on the difference. This is classic feedback control."
