            ],
            "correctAnswer": "1/3 s",
            "explanation": "Time constant τ = 1/|pole| = 1/3 s ≈ 0.33 s. The response e^(-3t) decays to 37% in 0.33 seconds. Larger pole magnitude means faster response."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Decaying oscillation",
            "explanation": "Real part -2 < 0 means decay (stable). Imaginary part ±3j means oscillation at 3 rad/s. Combined: damped sinusoid e^(-2t)cos(3t). Common in underdamped systems."

            "explanation": "Zeros are where the numerator = 0, making H(s) = 0. At this frequency, output is blocked. Zeros shape the frequency response but don't directly affect stability."
