# Exam Focus: Pole-Zero Analysis

## Key Formulas

1. **Time constant**: τ = 1/|pole|
2. **Damping ratio**: ζ = cos(angle from -ve real axis)
3. **Natural frequency**: ωₙ = |pole|
4. **Damped frequency**: ωd = ωₙ√(1-ζ²)

## Stability Rules

- All poles in LHP → Stable
- Any pole in RHP → Unstable
- Simple poles on jω-axis → Marginally stable
- Repeated poles on jω-axis → Unstable

## Common Exam Tasks

1. Plot poles/zeros given H(s)
2. Determine stability from pole locations
3. Find time constant and settling time
4. Calculate damping ratio and overshoot
5. Sketch impulse/step response from poles
