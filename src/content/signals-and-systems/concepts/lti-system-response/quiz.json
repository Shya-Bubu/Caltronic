        {
            "id": "q1",
            "prompt": "What is the impulse response of an LTI system?",
            "options": [
                "The output when input is a step function",
                "The output when input is an impulse δ[n]",
                "The input required to get impulse output",
                "The system's transfer function"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "The output when input is an impulse δ[n]",
            "explanation": "The impulse response h[n] is defined as the output of an LTI system when the input is an impulse δ[n]. This completely characterizes the system. The step response is different. The transfer function is a frequency domain concept."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2",
            "prompt": "If h[n] is the impulse response, what is the output when input is δ[n-3]?",
            "options": [
                "h[n]",
                "h[n+3]",
                "h[n-3]",
                "3h[n]"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "h[n-3]",
            "explanation": "Due to time invariance, a shifted impulse δ[n-3] produces a shifted impulse response h[n-3]. The shift in input equals the shift in output. h[n+3] would be an advance, not delay. 3h[n] confuses delay with scaling."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3",
            "prompt": "How can any discrete signal x[n] be represented using impulses?",
            "options": [
                "x[n] = x[0]δ[n]",
                "x[n] = Σ x[k]δ[n-k]",

                "x[n] = x[n]δ[n]"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "x[n] = Σ x[k]δ[n-k]",
            "explanation": "Any signal can be written as x[n] = Σ x[k]δ[n-k], which is a sum of scaled shifted impulses. This representation is key to deriving convolution. The other options don't properly represent the signal decomposition."
        },

            "id": "q4",
            "prompt": "For an LTI system, if 2δ[n] produces output 2h[n], which property is demonstrated?",
            "options": [
                "Time invariance",
                "Causality",
                "Linearity (homogeneity)",
                "Stability"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Linearity (homogeneity)",
            "explanation": "Homogeneity (part of linearity) states that scaling the input by a constant scales the output by the same constant. 2δ[n] → 2h[n] demonstrates this. Time invariance deals with shifts, not scaling."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Convolution",
            "explanation": "The asterisk (*) denotes convolution, not multiplication. Convolution is defined as y[n] = Σ x[k]h[n-k]. Point-by-point multiplication would be written as x[n]·h[n]. Cross-correlation uses a different formula."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6",
            "prompt": "If a system is NOT time-invariant, can we use convolution to find its output?",
            "options": [
                "Yes, always",
                "Yes, but only for step inputs",
                "No, convolution requires time invariance",
                "Only for continuous-time systems"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "No, convolution requires time invariance",
            "explanation": "Convolution only applies to LTI systems. Without time invariance, shifting the input changes the system behavior, breaking the convolution relationship. Both properties (linear AND time-invariant) are required."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7",
            "prompt": "What is the relationship between impulse response h[n] and step response s[n]?",
            "options": [
                "h[n] = s[n]",
                "h[n] = s[n] - s[n-1]",
                "s[n] = h[n] - h[n-1]",
                "No relationship exists"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "h[n] = s[n] - s[n-1]",
            "explanation": "The impulse is the derivative (difference) of the step, so h[n] = s[n] - s[n-1]. Equivalently, s[n] = Σ h[k] for k ≤ n. They are definitely related through differentiation/integration."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8",
            "prompt": "What happens when you convolve any signal x[n] with δ[n]?",
            "options": [
                "You get zero",
                "You get δ[n]",
                "You get x[n]",
                "You get x[0]"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "You get x[n]",
            "explanation": "The impulse δ[n] is the identity of convolution: x[n] * δ[n] = x[n]. Convolving with δ[n] returns the original signal unchanged. This is analogous to multiplying by 1."

        {
            "id": "q9",
            "prompt": "Why is the impulse response important for LTI system analysis?",
            "options": [
                "It's the simplest input to generate",
                "It completely characterizes the system",
                "It's required for Fourier transforms",
                "It determines system stability only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "It completely characterizes the system",
            "explanation": "Knowing h[n] allows you to compute the output for ANY input via convolution. One simple experiment (impulse input) characterizes the entire system. While it helps with stability and transforms, complete characterization is its main importance."

            "id": "q10",

                "BIBO stability"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Superposition",
            "explanation": "Superposition (part of linearity) states that the response to a sum of inputs is the sum of individual responses. This lets us add all the shifted impulse responses. Time invariance handles shifts, not sums."
