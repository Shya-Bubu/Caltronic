        {
            "id": "cp-q1",
            "prompt": "Commutativity of convolution means:",
            "options": [
                "x*h = h*x",
                "x*h = x·h",
                "(x*h)*g = x*(h*g)",
                "x*δ = x"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "x*h = h*x",
            "explanation": "We can swap the order of signals in convolution. This means in graphical convolution, we can flip either signal—whichever is simpler. Mathematically, changing roles of x and h doesn't change the result."
        },
        {
            "id": "cp-q2",
            "prompt": "Associativity means (x*h₁)*h₂ =:",
            "options": [
                "x*(h₁*h₂)",
                "x*h₁ + x*h₂",

                "(x+h₁)*h₂"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "x*(h₁*h₂)",
            "explanation": "We can group convolutions as we like. For cascaded systems, we can first combine the impulse responses by convolving them, then convolve once with input. Order of computation doesn't affect result."
        },
        {
            "id": "cp-q3",
            "prompt": "Distributivity: x*(h₁+h₂) =:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "x*h₁ + x*h₂",
            "explanation": "Convolution distributes over addition. This represents parallel systems: input goes to both h₁ and h₂, and outputs add. We can analyze each path separately and sum results at the end."
        },
        {
            "id": "cp-q4",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "x(t-T)",
            "explanation": "Shifting the impulse by T shifts the output by T. The shifted impulse acts as a delay line. This is one of the most useful convolution properties for understanding time delays in systems."
        },
        {
            "id": "cp-q5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Inverse system",
            "explanation": "If cascading h₁ and h₂ gives identity (δ), then h₂ undoes what h₁ does. h₂ is the inverse system of h₁. Finding inverse systems is important for equalization and deconvolution problems."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Either (dx/dt)*h or x*(dh/dt)",
            "explanation": "We can differentiate either signal: d/dt[x*h] = (dx/dt)*h = x*(dh/dt). Choose whichever is easier. This flexibility often simplifies calculations, especially when one signal is harder to differentiate."
        },

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "K·y",
            "explanation": "Scaling property: (Kx)*h = K(x*h) = Ky. Convolution is linear in both arguments. Doubling input doubles output. This follows from the linearity of the integral defining convolution."

                "y(t/a)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "(1/|a|)y(at)",
            "explanation": "When both signals are time-scaled by a, the convolution scales too but with a factor 1/|a|. This is because time compression of both signals changes the integration measure. Important for analyzing modulated signals."

                "2·rect(t)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "tri(t) (triangle)",
            "explanation": "Self-convolution of a rectangle gives a triangle function. As the flipped rect slides over, overlap starts at zero, increases linearly to maximum overlap, then decreases linearly. This produces the characteristic triangular shape."

            "id": "cp-q10",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "width_x + width_h",
            "explanation": "Duration adds in convolution. A signal of duration 3 convolved with duration 2 gives duration 5. This makes intuitive sense: output starts when input first hits the system and ends when the last of input clears."
