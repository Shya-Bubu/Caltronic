            "correctAnswer": "A variation of a physical property over time or space",
            "explanation": "A signal is defined as the variation of a physical property (like voltage, temperature, pressure) over an independent variable such as time or space. Examples include speech signals (air pressure vs time) and images (intensity vs spatial coordinates).",
