            ],
            "correctAnswer": "1",
            "explanation": "By definition, the unit impulse has unit area: the integral of δ(t) over all time equals 1. This is one of the defining properties of the Dirac delta function. The delta function is zero everywhere except at t=0, but its integral is exactly 1.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "0",
            "explanation": "Using the sifting property, we substitute t = 0.5 into cos(πt): cos(π·0.5) = cos(π/2) = 0. The impulse 'picks out' the value of the function at t = 0.5. This is the most useful property of the delta function in signal processing.",

            "correctAnswer": "1",
            "explanation": "Unlike the continuous Dirac delta, the discrete-time impulse δ[n] is simply 1 at n=0 and 0 everywhere else. It's a regular sequence, not a distribution. This makes it much easier to work with mathematically than the continuous delta function.",

            "correctAnswer": "0.5δ(t)",
            "explanation": "The scaling property states δ(at) = (1/|a|)δ(t). Here a=2, so δ(2t) = (1/2)δ(t) = 0.5δ(t). Time compression makes the impulse 'shorter' but compensates by halving its strength to maintain unit area.",

            "correctAnswer": "δ(t)",
            "explanation": "The unit step has a discontinuous jump at t=0. Its derivative is the unit impulse δ(t), which captures this 'instantaneous' transition from 0 to 1. Conversely, integrating δ(t) gives u(t). This relationship is fundamental in signals and systems.",

            "explanation": "When multiplying a function by a shifted delta, the function is evaluated at the location of the impulse. So f(t)·δ(t-a) = f(a)·δ(t-a). The function value is 'frozen' at t=a. This is the basis of the sifting property.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "9",
            "explanation": "Using the sifting property, the integral equals t² evaluated at t=3, which is 3² = 9. The delta function 'sifts out' the value of the function at the location of the impulse. This is perhaps the most important property for problem-solving.",

            "correctAnswer": "δ(t)",
            "explanation": "The delta function is even: δ(-t) = δ(t). This is because the delta is only nonzero at t=0, and reflecting about zero leaves it unchanged. This symmetry property is often useful when simplifying expressions involving delta functions.",

            "correctAnswer": "1",
            "explanation": "The Laplace transform of δ(t) is L{δ(t)} = ∫δ(t)e^(-st)dt = e^(-s·0) = 1. The impulse function has a flat frequency spectrum, containing all frequencies equally. This makes it perfect for testing system responses.",

            "correctAnswer": "x(t-T)",
            "explanation": "Convolving any signal with a shifted impulse δ(t-T) simply delays the signal by T. This is because the impulse acts as an identity element for convolution at t=0, and shifting it to t=T shifts the entire convolved output. This property is fundamental to understanding LTI systems."
