            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Left half-plane",
            "explanation": "For BIBO (Bounded-Input Bounded-Output) stability of causal systems, ALL poles must have Re(s) < 0. Poles in LHP give decaying exponentials. Any pole with Re(s) ≥ 0 causes instability."

            "correctAnswer": "Unstable",
            "explanation": "Pole at s = +3 is in the right half-plane (Re(s) = 3 > 0). This gives h(t) = e^(3t)u(t), which grows without bound. The system is unstable—bounded inputs produce unbounded outputs."

            "explanation": "Poles at s = ±2j are on the jω-axis (Re(s) = 0). Simple poles on jω-axis give sustained oscillation. h(t) = 0.5sin(2t)u(t)—bounded but doesn't decay. Some bounded inputs cause resonance."

            "explanation": "Complex pole at s = -2+3j: Re(s) = -2 < 0 (stable, decaying), Im(s) = 3 (oscillation at ω = 3 rad/s). The response is e^(-2t)cos(3t+φ)—oscillation that dies out. Common in underdamped systems."

            "explanation": "h(t) = e^(-t)u(t) gives ∫|h(t)|dt = ∫e^(-t)dt = 1 < ∞. Absolutely integrable means BIBO stable. Pole at s = -1 is in LHP. Any decaying exponential indicates stability."

            "explanation": "Denominator s²+2s+5 has roots s = -1±2j. Both poles have Re(s) = -1 < 0, so in LHP. The system is stable. The zero at s=0 doesn't affect stability—only poles matter for stability."

            "explanation": "BIBO stability ⟺ ∫|h(t)|dt < ∞. The impulse response must be absolutely integrable. This is stronger than just bounded—h(t) must decay fast enough that its total 'area' is finite."

            "explanation": "Simple pole at origin gives h(t) containing u(t)—a constant that never decays. Bounded but doesn't go to zero. System is marginally stable. Example: pure integrator. A double pole at origin would be unstable."
