            "options": [
                "y(t) = Σx[k]h[n-k]",
                "y(t) = ∫x(τ)h(t-τ)dτ",
                "y(t) = x(t)·h(t)",
                "y(t) = ∫x(t)h(t)dt"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "y(t) = ∫x(τ)h(t-τ)dτ",
            "explanation": "The continuous convolution integral is y(t) = ∫x(τ)h(t-τ)dτ, where τ is the integration variable and t is the output time. The sum form is for discrete, not continuous signals."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Integration",
            "explanation": "Integration replaces summation when moving from discrete to continuous. The sum Σ becomes the integral ∫. This is because continuous signals have infinitely many points in any interval."

            "explanation": "The Dirac delta is the identity of convolution. x(t) * δ(t) = x(t), just like in discrete. Convolving with the impulse returns the original signal unchanged."

            "correctAnswer": "[0, t]",
            "explanation": "For causal signals (zero for t<0), the integrand is non-zero only when 0≤τ≤t, so limits become [0, t]. This reduces computation significantly."

            "correctAnswer": "Multiplication",
            "explanation": "The convolution theorem states: L{x*h} = X(s)·H(s). Convolution in time becomes multiplication in s-domain. This is why Laplace transforms are so powerful for system analysis."

            "explanation": "The step response s(t) = u(t) * h(t) is the output when input is a unit step. δ(t) * h(t) = h(t) is the impulse response by definition."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "dx/dt * h = x * dh/dt",
            "explanation": "Differentiation can be applied to either signal: d/dt(x*h) = (dx/dt)*h = x*(dh/dt). Note this is NOT the product rule—convolution differentiation works differently."

            "explanation": "The convolution of step with exponential gives y(t) = (1 - e^(-t))u(t), the classic RC circuit charging curve. It starts at 0 and approaches 1 asymptotically."

            "explanation": "Continuous convolution requires evaluating integrals, which often involves calculus techniques like integration by parts. Discrete convolution is just arithmetic—multiplication and addition."
