            "options": [
                "Xk = ∫x(t)dt",
                "Xk = (1/T₀)∫x(t)e^(-jkω₀t)dt",
                "Xk = Σx(t)e^(jkω₀t)",
                "Xk = x(t)·e^(-jkω₀t)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Xk = (1/T₀)∫x(t)e^(-jkω₀t)dt",
            "explanation": "The analysis equation is Xk = (1/T₀)∫x(t)e^(-jkω₀t)dt, integrated over one period. The 1/T₀ factor normalizes the result, and the exponential with -jkω₀t extracts the kth harmonic."

                "The fundamental frequency",
                "The average value of x(t)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "The average value of x(t)",
            "explanation": "When k=0, the exponential becomes 1, so X₀ = (1/T₀)∫x(t)dt, which is exactly the average value of x(t) over one period."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "0.5",
            "explanation": "50% duty cycle means the pulse is high for half the period. If amplitude is 1, the average is 1×0.5 + 0×0.5 = 0.5."

            "options": [
                "Because sin(kx) oscillates faster",
                "Because the integral cancels out high frequencies",
                "Because high harmonics have less energy",

            "correctAnswer": "All of the above",
            "explanation": "High-frequency exponentials oscillate rapidly in the integration window, causing positive and negative contributions to cancel. This means smooth signals have little high-frequency content."

            "correctAnswer": "When kω₀T₁ = nπ (n integer)",
            "explanation": "Xk = 0 when sin(kω₀T₁) = 0, which occurs when the argument equals nπ for any non-zero integer n. This creates the 'nulls' in the sinc-like spectrum."

            "correctAnswer": "Overshoot at discontinuities",

            "correctAnswer": "-T₀/2 to +T₀/2",
            "explanation": "For signals symmetric about t=0, using -T₀/2 to +T₀/2 often simplifies integration because you may only need to integrate over non-zero regions once."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "1/k²",
            "explanation": "Triangle waves are continuous (unlike square waves), so their Fourier coefficients decay faster—as 1/k² instead of 1/k. Smoother signals have faster-decaying spectra."

            "correctAnswer": "Orthogonality",
