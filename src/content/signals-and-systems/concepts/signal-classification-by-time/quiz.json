                "x(t)",

                "x<n>"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "x[n]",
            "explanation": "Brackets [n] indicate discrete-time signals, defined only at integer values. Parentheses (t) indicate continuous-time signals defined for all real t values. This is a universal convention in signals and systems."

            "options": [
                "Integer values only",
                "All real values of t",

                "Rational values only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "All real values of t",
            "explanation": "Continuous-time signals x(t) are defined for every real value of the independent variable tâ€”you can zoom in infinitely and the signal remains defined. Discrete signals are only at integers."

        {
            "id": "q3",
            "prompt": "What is the Nyquist sampling rate for a 10 kHz signal?",
            "options": [
                "5 kHz",
                "10 kHz",
                "20 kHz",
                "40 kHz"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "20 kHz",
            "explanation": "The Nyquist theorem states: sample at fs > 2Ã—fmax. For a 10 kHz signal, Nyquist rate = 2 Ã— 10 kHz = 20 kHz. Sampling below this causes aliasing."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Sampling rate is below Nyquist",
            "explanation": "Aliasing occurs when sampling below Nyquist rate (fs < 2Ã—fmax), causing high frequencies to 'fold' and appear as lower frequencies. High sampling rate prevents aliasing. DC and periodicity are unrelated."

            "explanation": "An Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) converts continuous-time analog signals to discrete-time digital signals through sampling and quantization. DAC does the reverse."

            "options": [
                "It's the minimum possible",
                "Human hearing is up to ~20 kHz",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Human hearing is up to ~20 kHz",
            "explanation": "Human hearing ranges up to ~20 kHz. Per Nyquist, we need fs > 40 kHz. CD uses 44.1 kHz which exceeds this requirement and provides a safety margin for anti-aliasing filters."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Undefined",
            "explanation": "Discrete-time signals x[n] are only defined at integer indices. x[1.5] is undefined (not zero!)â€”the signal simply doesn't exist between sample points. This is fundamental to discrete signal definition."

            "correctAnswer": "Anti-aliasing filter",
            "explanation": "An anti-aliasing filter (lowpass filter) is applied before sampling to remove frequency components above Nyquist, preventing them from folding back and corrupting the signal."
