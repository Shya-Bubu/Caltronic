                "(1/T)∫x(t)e^(-jkω₀t)dt",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "(1/T)∫x(t)e^(-jkω₀t)dt",
            "explanation": "The analysis equation cₖ = (1/T)∫x(t)e^(-jkω₀t)dt extracts the k-th harmonic coefficient. The 1/T factor normalizes by period. Integration is over any complete period. Note the negative sign in the exponent."

            "correctAnswer": "(1/T)∫x(t)dt",
            "explanation": "For k=0, the exponential e^0 = 1, so c₀ = (1/T)∫x(t)dt. This is just the average value of x(t) over one period. It's the DC component, representing any constant offset in the signal."

            "explanation": "By definition or L'Hopital's rule, sinc(x) = sin(πx)/(πx) approaches 1 as x→0. This is crucial because many Fourier transforms involve sinc, and knowing its value at origin helps sketch spectra."

            "explanation": "Odd symmetry x(-t) = -x(t) forces coefficients to be purely imaginary. This follows from the integral property: odd function times e^(-jkω₀t) over symmetric limits yields imaginary result only."

            "explanation": "Pulse train coefficients follow cₖ = (Aτ/T)·sinc(kτ/T). The sinc envelope determines how coefficients decay with k. Narrower pulses have wider sinc envelope, meaning more high-frequency content."

            "explanation": "sinc(n) = sin(nπ)/(nπ) = 0 for all nonzero integers n because sin(nπ) = 0. The sinc function has zeros at all nonzero integers. Only at n=0 does sinc(n) = 1."
