            "correctAnswer": "B",
            "explanation": "The analysis equation is X_k = (1/T₀) ∫_{T₀} x(t) e^{-jkω₀t} dt. Note: (1) the 1/T₀ normalisation factor, (2) the minus sign in the exponent, and (3) the integral is over one complete period T₀, not from -∞ to ∞ (that would be the Fourier Transform)."

            "explanation": "The synthesis equation is x(t) = Σ_{k=-∞}^{∞} X_k e^{+jkω₀t}. The plus sign in the exponent is the opposite of the analysis equation. There is no 1/T₀ factor — that factor already appeared in the analysis equation when computing X_k."

            "explanation": "X₀ = (1/T₀)∫_{T₀} x(t) dt, which is the average (mean) value of x(t) over one period. When k=0, the exponential e^{-j·0·t} = 1, so the integral becomes a plain average."

            "explanation": "When m ≠ k, the integrand e^{j(m-k)ω₀t} is a complex exponential at a non-zero harmonic frequency. Its integral over a complete period is zero (positive and negative areas cancel). When m = k, e^{j·0·t} = 1, so the integral equals T₀."

            "correctAnswer": "C",
            "explanation": "Analysis: e^{−jkω₀t} (minus). Synthesis: e^{+jkω₀t} (plus). This sign convention is analogous to the Fourier Transform pair. The minus sign in analysis 'demodulates' the k-th harmonic; the plus sign in synthesis 'remodulates' it."

            "correctAnswer": "C",
            "explanation": "The periodicity of x(t) means that the integral over any contiguous interval of length T₀ gives the same result. Choose the interval that simplifies the calculation — for symmetric signals, [−T₀/2, +T₀/2] is often easiest."

            "explanation": "|X_k| → 0 as |k| → ∞ for signals with finite power. This means higher harmonics contribute less and less, which is why truncating the series to a finite number of terms still gives a reasonable approximation."

            "explanation": "The Gibbs phenomenon is the persistent ~9% overshoot that occurs near discontinuities in a signal when reconstructed using a finite Fourier Series. Adding more terms makes the overshoot narrower but not smaller — it is an inherent limitation of Fourier approximation of discontinuous signals."
