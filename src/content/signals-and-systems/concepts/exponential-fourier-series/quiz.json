            "options": [
                "e^(jθ) = cos(θ) + j·sin(θ)",
                "e^(jθ) = cos(θ) - j·sin(θ)",

                "e^(jθ) = 1 + jθ"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "e^(jθ) = cos(θ) + j·sin(θ)",
            "explanation": "Euler's formula states e^(jθ) = cos(θ) + j·sin(θ). The imaginary part is +j·sin(θ), not negative. This is the fundamental relationship connecting exponentials to trigonometric functions."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "(e^(jθ) - e^(-jθ))/2j",
            "explanation": "sin(θ) = (e^(jθ) - e^(-jθ))/(2j). The cosine formula uses addition and divides by 2. The 2j in the denominator is crucial—without the 2, you'd get twice the actual value."

            "correctAnswer": "The DC (average) component",
            "explanation": "X₀ is the coefficient for k=0, which corresponds to e^(j·0·ω₀t) = 1, a constant. Thus X₀ is the DC or average value of the signal over one period."

            "correctAnswer": "2.5",
            "explanation": "Using cos(θ) = (e^(jθ) + e^(-jθ))/2: 5cos(10t) = (5/2)e^(j10t) + (5/2)e^(-j10t). So X₁ = 5/2 = 2.5 (real, with zero phase)."

            "correctAnswer": "-j",
            "explanation": "To find 1/j, multiply top and bottom by j: 1/j = j/(j·j) = j/(-1) = -j. This is equivalent to e^(-jπ/2)."

            "correctAnswer": "3",
            "explanation": "There are 3 non-zero coefficients: X₀ = 3 (DC), X₁ and X₋₁ (from the sine term). The sine produces two exponentials at ±ω₀."

            "correctAnswer": "X₋k = Xk*",
            "explanation": "For real signals, X₋k = Xk* (complex conjugate). This means |X₋k| = |Xk| (symmetric magnitude) and ∠X₋k = -∠Xk (antisymmetric phase)."
