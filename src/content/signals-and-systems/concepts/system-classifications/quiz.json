                "Causal",
                "Non-causal",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Causal",
            "explanation": "The output depends on past input x(t-1), which occurred before the current time t. Since it doesn't depend on future inputs, it's causal. Causal systems can be implemented in real-time because they only need past/present data."

            "options": [
                "Output depends on current input only",
                "Output depends on past inputs",
                "Output depends on future inputs",
                "Output is always zero"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Output depends on current input only",
            "explanation": "Memoryless systems have output y(t) depending only on x(t). They have no 'memory' of past values. Examples include resistors (v=iR) and ideal amplifiers (y=Kx). They cannot perform integration or differentiation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Non-causal",
            "explanation": "The output at time t depends on input at time t+2, which is in the future. This is non-causal and cannot be implemented in real-time. Non-causal systems are used in offline processing where all data is available."

            "id": "sc-q4",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Shifting input shifts output by same amount",
            "explanation": "A time-invariant system satisfies: if x(t)→y(t), then x(t-T)→y(t-T) for any T. The system behavior doesn't change over time. This property is essential for LTI system analysis using convolution."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Both B and C",
            "explanation": "The multiplication by t makes the system behavior change with time (time-variant). However, it's still linear because scaling x scales y, and superposition holds. Many real systems are linear but time-variant, like a fading communication channel."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Bounded input gives bounded output",
            "explanation": "BIBO (Bounded-Input Bounded-Output) stability means |x(t)| < M implies |y(t)| < N for some finite M and N. This is the most practical stability definition: the system won't 'blow up' for reasonable inputs."

            "correctAnswer": "a·x₁ + b·x₂ → a·y₁ + b·y₂",
            "explanation": "Superposition combines additivity (x₁+x₂→y₁+y₂) and homogeneity (ax→ay). If x₁→y₁ and x₂→y₂, then any linear combination a·x₁+b·x₂ gives a·y₁+b·y₂. This is the defining property of linear systems."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Nonlinear",
            "explanation": "Squaring violates homogeneity: if input is 2x(t), output is 4x²(t), not 2x²(t). The output scales by the square of the input scaling factor. Nonlinear systems don't obey superposition and can't use convolution analysis."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Causal, linear, time-invariant",
            "explanation": "Delay by T>0 means output uses past input (causal). It's linear (superposition holds) and time-invariant (shifting input shifts output equally). An ideal delay line is an example of a perfect LTI system."

            "correctAnswer": "Not strictly an LTI system response",
            "explanation": "LTI system analysis assumes zero initial conditions (relaxed system). Non-zero ICs contribute an additional 'zero-input response' that must be handled separately. The total response is the sum of zero-state and zero-input responses."
