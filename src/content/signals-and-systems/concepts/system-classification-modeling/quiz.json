            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Continuous-time system",
            "explanation": "Continuous-time systems are modeled by differential equations because they deal with continuous signals x(t) where derivatives dx/dt are defined. Discrete-time systems use difference equations instead."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Discrete-time system",
            "explanation": "A bank balance is updated at discrete time intervals (monthly), making it a discrete-time system. The balance y[n] depends on previous balance y[n-1] plus interest and deposits, forming a difference equation."

            "correctAnswer": "Second order",
            "explanation": "The order of a differential equation (and thus the system) is determined by the highest derivative. Here d²v/dt² is the highest, making it a second-order system."

            "explanation": "The equation y[n] = 0.5y[n-1] + x[n] uses discrete indices [n] and [n-1], characteristic of difference equations for discrete-time systems. All other options use continuous-time notation."

            "correctAnswer": "RC",
            "explanation": "For an RC circuit, the time constant τ = RC determines how quickly the system responds. After time t = τ, the response reaches about 63.2% of its final value."
