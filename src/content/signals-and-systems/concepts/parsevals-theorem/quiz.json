            ],
            "correctAnswer": "B",
            "explanation": "P_avg = Σ_{k=-∞}^{∞} |X_k|². Each term |X_k|² is the power contribution of the k-th harmonic. The total power is the sum of all harmonic powers."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "A",
            "explanation": "P_avg = (1/T₀)∫_{T₀}|x(t)|² dt. This integrates the instantaneous power |x(t)|² over one period and normalises by T₀. For complex signals, |x(t)|² = x(t)·x*(t)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "B",
            "explanation": "Through the derivation, substituting the FS for x(t) and x*(t), the cross-terms vanish due to orthogonality (only k=m terms survive). This is why Parseval's is sometimes called a consequence of orthogonality."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "B",
            "explanation": "For real signals, |X_{-k}| = |X_k|. So the sum from -∞ to +∞ can be written as |X₀|² (the DC term once) plus 2·Σ|X_k|² for k=1 to ∞ (positive and negative k pairs)."

            "correctAnswer": "B",
            "explanation": "Both sides must give the same number. If you compute P from the time integral and from Σ|X_k|² and they don't match, your FS coefficients are wrong. This is a powerful verification tool."

            "correctAnswer": "A",
            "explanation": "A periodic signal extends to ±∞, so its total energy is infinite. But the average power per period (P_avg = (1/T₀)∫|x|²dt) is finite. Hence: power signals."

            "correctAnswer": "C",
            "explanation": "Essential bandwidth depends on how much power is 'enough'. For 95% capture, ~10 harmonics suffice (bandwidth ≈ 10ω₀). For 99%, you need ~20 (bandwidth ≈ 20ω₀). The choice depends on the application."
