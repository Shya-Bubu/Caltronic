            "options": [
                "Shift h[k]",
                "Flip h[k] to h[-k]",
                "Multiply x[k] and h[k]",
                "Sum all values"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Flip h[k] to h[-k]",
            "explanation": "The first step is to flip (time-reverse) h[k] to get h[-k]. Then you shift, multiply, and sum. Forgetting to flip is a common mistake that leads to incorrect results."

            "options": [
                "3",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "6",
            "explanation": "Output length = N₁ + N₂ - 1 = 3 + 4 - 1 = 6 samples. This accounts for all possible overlaps between the signals. Not 7 (that would be N₁+N₂), and not 3 or 4 (those are input lengths)."

            "explanation": "The impulse δ[n] is the identity element of convolution. Convolving any signal with δ[n] returns the original signal unchanged, just like multiplying by 1."

            "explanation": "Convolving with a shifted impulse δ[n-3] delays the signal by 3 samples. The result is x[n-3]. This is a fundamental property used in digital delay lines."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Yes, always",
            "explanation": "Convolution is commutative: x * h = h * x. This can be proven by substitution in the convolution sum. The order doesn't matter mathematically, though we often flip h by convention."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Associativity",
            "explanation": "Associativity allows regrouping of cascaded convolutions. This means cascaded LTI systems can be combined into a single equivalent system with combined impulse response."

            "correctAnswer": "h[-k] shifted right by n",
            "explanation": "h[n-k] = h[-(k-n)] is h[-k] shifted by n. First flip h[k] to get h[-k], then shift to get h[n-k]. This is the flip-then-shift operation of graphical convolution."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Multiplication",
            "explanation": "Convolution in time domain equals multiplication in frequency domain: Y(ω) = X(ω)·H(ω). This is the power of transform methods—they simplify convolution to multiplication."
        },

            "id": "q9",

            "correctAnswer": "(n+1)u[n]",
            "explanation": "u[n] * u[n] = (n+1)u[n], a ramp starting at n=0. This is because convolution of step with step gives the running sum, which grows linearly."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10",
            "prompt": "Why do we flip h[k] instead of x[k] when computing convolution?",

                "Convention only, either works",
                "Because h represents the system",
                "To ensure causality"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Convention only, either works",
            "explanation": "Due to commutativity, you can flip either signal. Convention is to flip h[k], but flipping x[k] gives the same result. Choose whichever is more convenient for your calculation."
