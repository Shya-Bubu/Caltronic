## 📝 Exam Focus: Trigonometric FS and Orthogonality

### Common Question Types

**Type 1: Convert EFS to trigonometric FS**
"Given X_k, find a_k and b_k." → Use a_k = X_k + X_{−k}, b_k = j(X_k − X_{−k}).

**Type 2: Prove orthogonality**
"Show that the FS basis functions are orthogonal." → Compute the inner product integral and show it's the Kronecker delta.

**Type 3: Find trig coefficients from integral**
"Compute a₃ for a given signal." → Use a_k = (2/T₀)∫x(t)cos(kω₀t)dt.

### Exam Tips

1. The trig FS sums from k = 1 to ∞ (not −∞ to ∞)
2. Remember the factor of 2 in the trig FS coefficient formulas
3. For orthogonality proofs, clearly separate the k = m and k ≠ m cases
4. EFS is generally preferred unless the question specifically asks for trigonometric form

### Marks Distribution (Typical)
- Conversion formulas: 2–3 marks
- Orthogonality proof: 4–5 marks
- Direct computation of a_k or b_k: 3–4 marks
