                "A) Sum of complex exponentials from −∞ to ∞",
                "B) a₀ + Σ(a_k cos kω₀t + b_k sin kω₀t) from k=1 to ∞",

            "correctAnswer": "B) a₀ + Σ(a_k cos kω₀t + b_k sin kω₀t) from k=1 to ∞",
            "explanation": "The trigonometric FS uses real-valued cosines and sines instead of complex exponentials. It sums from k=1 to ∞ (not −∞), with a₀ being the DC component. Each pair (a_k, b_k) corresponds to a pair (X_k, X_{−k}) in the EFS."

            "explanation": "a_k = X_k + X_{−k}. For real signals, X_{−k} = X_k*, so a_k = X_k + X_k* = 2Re(X_k). Similarly, b_k = j(X_k − X_k*) = −2Im(X_k)."

            "correctAnswer": "B) Their inner product is zero",
            "explanation": "Orthogonality means the inner product ⟨φ_k, φ_m⟩ = 0 for k ≠ m. This is the function analogue of perpendicular vectors having zero dot product."

            "explanation": "(1/T₀)∫e^{j(k−m)ω₀t}dt = 0 when k≠m (integer cycles integrate to zero) and = 1 when k=m. This Kronecker delta confirms orthonormality."

            "explanation": "When you project x(t) onto e^{jk₀ω₀t}, orthogonality means all other harmonics contribute zero to the integral. Only the k₀-th coefficient survives. No cross-talk = independent computation."
