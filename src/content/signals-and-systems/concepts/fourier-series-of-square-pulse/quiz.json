            "id": "q1",
            "prompt": "The DC component X₀ of a square pulse train with amplitude 1, width 2T₁, and period T₀ is:",
            "options": [
                "A) T₁/T₀",
                "B) 2T₁/T₀",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "B",
            "explanation": "X₀ = (1/T₀)∫_{-T₁}^{+T₁} 1 dt = 2T₁/T₀. This is simply the duty cycle — the fraction of the period during which the pulse is 'on'. For example, a 50% duty cycle gives X₀ = 0.5."

            "id": "q2",
            "prompt": "The general FS coefficient X_k of the square pulse train (for k ≠ 0) is:",

                "D) 2T₁/(k²π²)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "A",
            "explanation": "X_k = sin(kω₀T₁)/(kπ). This comes from evaluating the FS integral: integrating e^{-jkω₀t} over [-T₁, +T₁], using Euler's formula to recognise sin, and simplifying with ω₀T₀ = 2π."

        {
            "id": "q3",
            "prompt": "Why are all X_k real for the centred square pulse train?",
            "options": [
                "A) Because the signal is periodic",
                "B) Because the signal is real and even: x(t) = x(-t)",
                "C) Because the amplitude is 1",
                "D) Because k ranges from -∞ to +∞"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "B",
            "explanation": "A real, even signal has real FS coefficients. The centred square pulse is symmetric about t=0, so x(t) = x(-t). This even symmetry ensures that the imaginary parts cancel in the FS integral, leaving purely real X_k values."

                "D) Disappears"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "B",
            "explanation": "The main lobe width is inversely proportional to T₁. Halving the pulse width doubles the spectral width — narrower pulses require higher-frequency components to represent the sharper transitions. This is the fundamental bandwidth-duration trade-off."

            "correctAnswer": "A",
            "explanation": "The sinc envelope decays as 1/(kπ), which is a 1/k rate. This relatively slow decay is due to the sharp discontinuities in the square pulse. Smoother signals (like triangular waves) have faster decay rates (1/k²)."

            "correctAnswer": "B",
            "explanation": "X₀ = 2T₁/T₀ = 1/4 = 0.25. The pulse is on for 1 out of every 4 seconds, giving a 25% duty cycle. This is the average value of the signal."

            "correctAnswer": "B",
            "explanation": "X_k = sin(kω₀T₁)/(kπ) = 0 when sin(kω₀T₁) = 0, i.e., when kω₀T₁ = nπ for integer n ≠ 0. These zeros define the lobes of the sinc envelope."

            "correctAnswer": "C",
            "explanation": "At a jump discontinuity, the FS converges to the midpoint (arithmetic mean) of the left and right limits. For the square pulse jumping from 0 to 1, the FS converges to 0.5 at the discontinuity."

            "correctAnswer": "B",
            "explanation": "Shifting g(t) by integer multiples of T₀ and summing creates an infinite periodic repetition — the periodic extension. This is the standard way to define a periodic signal from a single-period template."

            "correctAnswer": "B",
            "explanation": "Narrow pulses (small T₁) produce wide spectra (many significant harmonics). This is the fundamental bandwidth-duration trade-off: to represent sharp time-domain features, you need many high-frequency components."
