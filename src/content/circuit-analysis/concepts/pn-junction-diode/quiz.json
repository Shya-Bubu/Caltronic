      "prompt": "The PN-junction diode equation is i = Is(e^(v/VT) - 1). What is VT at room temperature (T = 300K)?",

        "A) 0.7 V",
        "B) 0.026 V",
        "C) 0.26 V",
        "D) 2.6 V"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) 0.026 V",
      "explanation": "VT = kT/q = (1.381e-23 * 300) / 1.602e-19 = 0.02585 V, approximately 26 mV."

      "explanation": "v/VT = 0.6/0.026 = 23.1. e^23.1 = 1.08e10. i = 10^-12 * 1.08e10 = 0.0108 A = 10.8 mA, approximately 10 mA."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) -Is",
      "explanation": "For v << 0, e^(v/VT) approaches 0, so i = Is(0 - 1) = -Is. The current is -Is (reverse saturation current)."

        "D) Stays the same"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) Increases by a factor of 10",
      "explanation": "In forward bias, i is proportional to e^(v/VT). A 60 mV increase means delta(v/VT) = 0.060/0.026 = 2.31 = ln(10). So the current multiplies by e^2.31 = 10."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) VT approaches zero",
      "explanation": "As VT approaches 0, the exponential e^(v/VT) transitions from smooth to infinitely steep at v = 0, approaching the ideal diode's sharp two-segment characteristic."

      "id": "q10",
      "prompt": "Is the PN-junction diode passive or active?",
      "options": [
        "A) Active, because it is nonlinear",
        "B) Passive, because its v-i curve lies in quadrants I and III",
        "C) Active in forward bias, passive in reverse bias",
        "D) Neither; passivity only applies to linear resistors"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) Passive, because its v-i curve lies in quadrants I and III",
      "explanation": "For v > 0: i > 0 (quadrant I, p = vi > 0). For v < 0: i = -Is < 0 (quadrant III, p = vi > 0). The curve stays in quadrants I and III, so the diode is passive."
