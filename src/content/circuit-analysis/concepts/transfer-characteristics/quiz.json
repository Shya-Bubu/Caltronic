    {
      "id": "q1",
      "prompt": "A transfer characteristic describes:",
      "options": [
        "A) The v-i relationship at a single port",
        "B) The relationship between input at one port and output at a different port",
        "C) The power dissipated in a resistor",
        "D) The frequency response of the circuit"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) The relationship between input at one port and output at a different port",
      "explanation": "A transfer characteristic relates the output variable (at one port) to the input variable (at a different port). The word 'transfer' means the signal moves from the input port to the output port."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "prompt": "A driving-point characteristic differs from a transfer characteristic because:",
      "options": [
        "A) It involves AC signals only",
        "B) The input and response are measured at the same port",
        "C) It only applies to linear circuits",
        "D) It is always a straight line"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) The input and response are measured at the same port",
      "explanation": "In a driving-point characteristic, both the excitation (input) and the response (output) are at the same port. In a transfer characteristic, they are at different ports."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "prompt": "For two current-controlled resistors in series with input vi across both and output vo across R2, KCL gives:",
      "options": [
        "A) v1 = v2",
        "B) i1 + i2 = 0",
        "C) i = i1 = i2",
        "D) i1 = -i2"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) i = i1 = i2",
      "explanation": "In a series connection, a single current flows through both elements. KCL at the intermediate node forces i = i1 = i2."
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "prompt": "With vi = v-hat1(i) + v-hat2(i) and vo = v-hat2(i), the transfer characteristic vo(vi) is obtained by:",
      "options": [
        "A) Adding the two functions",
        "B) Multiplying the two functions",
        "C) Eliminating i from the two equations",
        "D) Differentiating vi with respect to vo"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) Eliminating i from the two equations",
      "explanation": "Both vi and vo are expressed in terms of the parameter i. To get vo as a function of vi, you must eliminate i: invert vi = f(i) to get i = f^{-1}(vi), then substitute into vo = h(i)."
    },
    {
      "id": "q5",
      "prompt": "When analytic elimination of i is not feasible, the recommended approach is:",
      "options": [
        "A) Assume i = 0",
        "B) Use the parametric method: compute (vi, vo) for many values of i",
        "C) Set v1 = v2",
        "D) Ignore the nonlinear element"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) Use the parametric method: compute (vi, vo) for many values of i",
      "explanation": "The parametric method avoids the need to invert f(i). Choose values of i, compute vi and vo for each, and plot the resulting (vi, vo) points."

    {
      "id": "q6",
      "prompt": "In a series circuit with a PN-junction diode (R1) and linear resistor R2, for vi well above the diode turn-on voltage, vo is approximately:",
      "options": [
        "A) vo = 0",
        "B) vo = vi",
        "C) vo = vi - V_gamma",
        "D) vo = V_gamma"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) vo = vi - V_gamma",
      "explanation": "Once the diode is fully on, its voltage is approximately pinned at V_gamma. KVL gives vo = vi - v1, and since v1 is roughly V_gamma, we get vo approximately equal to vi - V_gamma."
    },
    {
      "id": "q7",
      "prompt": "For vi below the diode turn-on voltage in the same circuit, vo is approximately:",
      "options": [
        "A) vo = vi",
        "B) vo = vi - V_gamma",
        "C) vo = 0",
        "D) vo = V_gamma"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) vo = 0",
      "explanation": "Below turn-on, the diode conducts negligible current. Since i is approximately 0, vo = R2 * i is approximately 0 as well."
    },
    {
      "id": "q8",
      "prompt": "For a linear voltage divider with R1 and R2, the transfer characteristic is:",
      "options": [
        "A) vo = (R1 + R2) * vi",
        "B) vo = R1 / (R1 + R2) * vi",
        "C) vo = R2 / (R1 + R2) * vi",
        "D) vo = R2 * R1 * vi"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) vo = R2 / (R1 + R2) * vi",
      "explanation": "For a resistive voltage divider, i = vi/(R1 + R2), so vo = R2 * i = R2/(R1 + R2) * vi. This is a straight line through the origin with slope less than 1."
    },
    {
      "id": "q9",
      "prompt": "The slope of the transfer characteristic at a given operating point represents:",
      "options": [
        "A) The resistance of the circuit",
        "B) The power gain",
        "C) The voltage gain (dvo/dvi)",
        "D) The current through the load"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) The voltage gain (dvo/dvi)",
      "explanation": "The slope dvo/dvi at any point on the transfer characteristic curve is the incremental (small-signal) voltage gain at that operating point."
    },
    {
      "id": "q10",
      "prompt": "A nonlinear transfer characteristic (varying slope) implies that the circuit:",
      "options": [
        "A) Cannot operate at DC",
        "B) Processes small and large signals identically",
        "C) Processes small and large signals differently, enabling functions like rectification",
        "D) Has no operating point"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) Processes small and large signals differently, enabling functions like rectification",
      "explanation": "Varying slope means the gain depends on the signal level. This is what allows nonlinear circuits to perform rectification, limiting, and other functions that are impossible with constant-slope (linear) circuits."
