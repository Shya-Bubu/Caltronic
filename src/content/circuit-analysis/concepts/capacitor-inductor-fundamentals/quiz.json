            "prompt": "The voltage-current relationship for a capacitor is:",
            "options": [
                "v = Ri",
                "i = C·dv/dt",
                "v = L·di/dt",
                "P = IV"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "i = C·dv/dt",
            "explanation": "The capacitor current is proportional to the rate of change of voltage. If voltage is constant, no current flows — the capacitor is an open circuit at DC. This is the fundamental equation for capacitive circuits."

                "A short circuit",
                "An open circuit",
                "A resistor",
                "A voltage source"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "An open circuit",
            "explanation": "At DC, dv/dt = 0, so i = C·0 = 0. No current flows — the capacitor acts as an open circuit. This is how you find steady-state values: replace C with open circuit."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "A short circuit",
            "explanation": "At DC, di/dt = 0, so v = L·0 = 0. Zero voltage across it — the inductor acts as a short circuit (a wire). Replace L with short circuit for steady-state analysis."

            "correctAnswer": "125 μJ",
            "explanation": "E = ½Cv² = ½ × 10×10⁻⁶ × 5² = ½ × 10⁻⁵ × 25 = 125 × 10⁻⁶ J = 125 μJ. Energy is proportional to the square of voltage."

            "correctAnswer": "Their state depends on the entire past current/voltage history",
            "explanation": "v(t) = v(t₀) + (1/C)∫i·dτ — the voltage depends on the integral of all past current. Unlike a resistor (v depends only on current NOW), capacitors and inductors have memory via integration."

            "correctAnswer": "An inductor",
            "explanation": "Duality swaps v↔i, C↔L, series↔parallel. The capacitor equation i = C·dv/dt becomes v = L·di/dt (the inductor equation) under this swap. Every capacitor theorem has a dual inductor theorem."

            "correctAnswer": "dq/dv at the operating point v",
            "explanation": "C(v) ≜ dq̂(v)/dv is the slope of the q-v characteristic at operating point v. For linear capacitors this is constant; for nonlinear ones (like varactors), it varies with voltage."

            "correctAnswer": "−300sin(100t) μA",
            "explanation": "i = C·dv/dt = 10⁻⁶ × d/dt[3cos(100t)] = 10⁻⁶ × (−300sin(100t)) = −300sin(100t) μA. Current leads voltage by 90° in a capacitor."

            "correctAnswer": "Φ and q",
            "explanation": "The memristor (postulated by Chua in 1971) links flux Φ and charge q — the 'missing' relationship. Resistor: v↔i, Capacitor: q↔v, Inductor: Φ↔i, Memristor: Φ↔q. This completes the symmetry."

            "correctAnswer": "Infinite (impulse)",
            "explanation": "The voltage would step from 0 to 5V instantaneously, so dv/dt → ∞ and i = C·dv/dt → ∞. This physical impossibility (in real circuits, wire resistance limits the current) leads to the impulse function δ(t) — studied in the next concept."
