    {
      "id": "q1",
      "prompt": "In a series connection of two resistors, KCL forces:",
      "options": [
        "A) The voltages to be equal: v = v1 = v2",
        "B) The currents to be equal: i = i1 = i2",
        "C) The powers to be equal: p1 = p2",
        "D) The resistances to add: R = R1 + R2 always"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) The currents to be equal: i = i1 = i2",
      "explanation": "In a series connection, the same current flows through both elements. KCL at the intermediate node gives i = i1 = i2."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "prompt": "In a series connection, KVL gives:",
      "options": [
        "A) i = i1 + i2",
        "B) v = v1 * v2",
        "C) v = v1 + v2",
        "D) v = max(v1, v2)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) v = v1 + v2",
      "explanation": "KVL around the loop containing both series elements and the port gives v = v1 + v2. The port voltage is the sum of the individual voltages."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "prompt": "Two current-controlled resistors with v1 = v-hat1(i) and v2 = v-hat2(i) are connected in series. The result is:",
      "options": [
        "A) Voltage-controlled with i = i-hat1(v) + i-hat2(v)",
        "B) Current-controlled with v = v-hat1(i) + v-hat2(i)",
        "C) Neither voltage-controlled nor current-controlled",
        "D) Current-controlled with v = v-hat1(i) * v-hat2(i)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) Current-controlled with v = v-hat1(i) + v-hat2(i)",
      "explanation": "Since i = i1 = i2 (series), we substitute into KVL: v = v-hat1(i) + v-hat2(i). This is a single-valued function of i, so the result is current-controlled."
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "prompt": "Graphical series addition means, at each current value:",
      "options": [
        "A) Multiply the voltages from each curve",
        "B) Add the voltages from each curve (horizontal stacking)",
        "C) Add the currents from each curve (vertical stacking)",
        "D) Take the average of the voltages"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) Add the voltages from each curve (horizontal stacking)",
      "explanation": "Series addition adds voltages at equal current. In the v-i plane (v horizontal, i vertical), this corresponds to horizontal stacking: at each height (current), add the horizontal positions (voltages)."

    {
      "id": "q5",
      "prompt": "A linear resistor R1 = 4 ohm is in series with a nonlinear resistor v2 = 3i + 2i^3. The combined v at i = 1A is:",
      "options": [
        "A) 5 V",
        "B) 7 V",
        "C) 9 V",
        "D) 12 V"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) 9 V",
      "explanation": "v1 = R1*i = 4(1) = 4V. v2 = 3(1) + 2(1)^3 = 5V. v = v1 + v2 = 4 + 5 = 9V."
    },
    {
      "id": "q6",
      "prompt": "If one resistor in a series pair has reversed terminals, the voltage contribution of that element becomes:",
      "options": [
        "A) v-hat1(i)",
        "B) -v-hat1(i)",
        "C) v-hat1(-i)",
        "D) -v-hat1(-i)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D) -v-hat1(-i)",
      "explanation": "Reversing terminals negates both v and i for that element. If the original contribution is v-hat1(i), the reversed contribution is -v-hat1(-i)."

      "id": "q7",
      "prompt": "For a bilateral resistor with reversed terminals, the contribution -v-hat(-i) simplifies to:",
      "options": [
        "A) -v-hat(i)",
        "B) v-hat(i)",
        "C) 0",
        "D) 2*v-hat(i)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) v-hat(i)",
      "explanation": "A bilateral resistor satisfies v-hat(-i) = -v-hat(i). So -v-hat(-i) = -(-v-hat(i)) = v-hat(i). The reversal has no effect."
    },
    {
      "id": "q8",
      "prompt": "A voltage-controlled resistor (i = i-hat(v1)) is in series with a current-controlled resistor (v2 = v-hat2(i)). The combined characteristic is best expressed as:",
      "options": [
        "A) A single closed-form voltage-controlled equation",
        "B) A single closed-form current-controlled equation",
        "C) A parametric representation using i as parameter",
        "D) It cannot be determined"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) A parametric representation using i as parameter",
      "explanation": "Since one is voltage-controlled and the other is current-controlled, clean addition is not possible. Using i as the parameter: v1 is found from i = i-hat1(v1), v2 = v-hat2(i), and v = v1 + v2."

        "B) R_eq = R1 + R2",
        "C) G_eq = G1 + G2",
        "D) R_eq = min(R1, R2)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) R_eq = R1 + R2",
      "explanation": "v = R1*i + R2*i = (R1 + R2)*i, so R_eq = R1 + R2. Conductances do not add in series; resistances do."

    {
      "id": "q10",
      "prompt": "The driving-point characteristic of a one-port is:",
      "options": [
        "A) The impedance at a single frequency",
        "B) The v-i relationship seen at the two terminals of the combination",
        "C) The power delivered to the port",
        "D) The Thevenin equivalent resistance"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) The v-i relationship seen at the two terminals of the combination",
      "explanation": "The driving-point characteristic is the complete v-i relationship at the port terminals. It describes how the combination behaves as a single two-terminal element."
