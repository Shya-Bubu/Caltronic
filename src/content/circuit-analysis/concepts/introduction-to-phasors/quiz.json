                "A) A time-varying sinusoidal signal",
                "B) A complex number representing the amplitude and phase of a sinusoid",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "B) A complex number representing the amplitude and phase of a sinusoid",
            "explanation": "A phasor is defined as a complex number V = Vm∠φ that captures the amplitude and phase of a sinusoid Vm·cos(ωt + φ). It does not include the time factor e^(jωt)."

            "options": [
                "A) 12∠45°",
                "B) 12cos(45°)",
                "C) 12e^(j1000t)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "A) 12∠45°",
            "explanation": "To extract the phasor, take the amplitude (12) and phase (45°) from the cosine. The frequency (1000 rad/s) is NOT included in the phasor — it is implicit."

            "correctAnswer": "B) 8∠(-30°)",
            "explanation": "First convert sine to cosine: sin(θ) = cos(θ - 90°). So i(t) = 8cos(ωt + 60° - 90°) = 8cos(ωt - 30°). The phasor is I = 8∠(-30°)."

            "correctAnswer": "B) Multiplication by jω",
            "explanation": "In the phasor domain, differentiating a sinusoid corresponds to multiplying its phasor by jω. This scales the amplitude by ω and shifts the phase by +90°."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "D) Both A and B are correct",
            "explanation": "v(t) = 20cos(500t - 90°) is the direct conversion. Since cos(θ - 90°) = sin(θ), this equals 20sin(500t). Both expressions are equivalent."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "D) Both B and C are correct",
            "explanation": "A negative cosine adds 180° to the phase: -5cos(ωt+30°) = 5cos(ωt+30°-180°) = 5cos(ωt-150°). So V = 5∠(-150°) = 5∠210°. Both representations are the same angle."

            "correctAnswer": "C) Frequency of the sinusoid",
            "explanation": "A phasor contains amplitude and phase only. The frequency ω is implicit — it is the same for all signals in the circuit and is understood from context."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "C) V/(jω)",
            "explanation": "Integration is the inverse of differentiation. If d/dt ↔ jω, then ∫dt ↔ 1/(jω). So integrating v(t) corresponds to dividing its phasor by jω."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "B) 45° below the positive real axis",
            "explanation": "A negative phase angle means the phasor is measured clockwise from the positive real axis. -45° puts it 45° below the real axis, in the fourth quadrant."

            "correctAnswer": "B) v(t) depends on time; V does not",
            "explanation": "v(t) is the instantaneous, time-varying, always-real signal. V is a time-independent complex number encoding amplitude and phase. v(t) is recovered via v(t) = Re{Ve^(jωt)}."
