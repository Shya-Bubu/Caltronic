        {
            "id": "q1",
            "prompt": "The additive property of phasors states that adding sinusoids of the same frequency is equivalent to:",
            "options": [
                "A) Adding their amplitudes",
                "B) Adding their phasors as complex numbers",
                "C) Multiplying their phasors",
                "D) Adding their frequencies"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "B) Adding their phasors as complex numbers",
            "explanation": "The additive property says that if v(t) = v₁(t) + v₂(t), then V = V₁ + V₂. You add the phasors as complex numbers (using rectangular form), not just magnitudes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2",
            "prompt": "Find the phasor sum: V₁ = 6∠0° + V₂ = 6∠90°.",

                "D) 6∠45°"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "B) 6√2∠45°",
            "explanation": "V₁ = 6 + j0. V₂ = 0 + j6. Sum = 6 + j6. Magnitude = √(36+36) = 6√2. Angle = tan⁻¹(6/6) = 45°. So the sum is 6√2∠45°."

                "B) Yes, but only in rectangular form",
                "C) No, phasor addition requires the same frequency",
                "D) No, but you can multiply them"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "C) No, phasor addition requires the same frequency",
            "explanation": "The additive property relies on factoring out a common e^(jωt). If the frequencies differ, the time factors are different and cannot be combined into a single phasor."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "B) Multiplication by jω",
            "explanation": "Differentiating v(t) = Re{Ve^(jωt)} gives Re{jωVe^(jωt)}. So the phasor of dv/dt is jωV — multiplication by jω."

                "D) Reflects across the real axis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "C) Rotates by 90° counterclockwise",
            "explanation": "Since j = 1∠90°, multiplying by j adds 90° to the phase angle without changing the magnitude. This is a 90° counterclockwise rotation."
        },

            "id": "q6",
            "prompt": "If two phasors are equal in magnitude but 180° apart in phase, their sum is:",

                "C) The magnitude at 90°",
                "D) The magnitude at 0°"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "B) Zero",
            "explanation": "Phasors 180° apart point in opposite directions. Like vectors, they cancel completely: V∠0° + V∠180° = V + (-V) = 0."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "B) Dividing by jω",
            "explanation": "Integration is the inverse of differentiation. Since d/dt ↔ jω, integration ∫dt ↔ 1/(jω). This divides the magnitude by ω and shifts the phase by -90°."

            "explanation": "V = 10∠60°. Derivative phasor = jωV = (100∠90°)(10∠60°) = 1000∠(90°+60°) = 1000∠150°."
