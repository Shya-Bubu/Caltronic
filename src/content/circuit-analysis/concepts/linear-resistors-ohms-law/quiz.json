        "A) 800 mA",
        "B) 20 mA",
        "C) 50 mA",
        "D) 0.5 mA"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) 20 mA",
      "explanation": "i = v/R = 4/200 = 0.02A = 20mA — This is the correct answer based on the circuit theory principles discussed in this concept."

        "D) sqrt(R)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) 1/R (= G)",
      "explanation": "On the v-i plane (v horizontal, i vertical), slope = di/dv = G = 1/R"

        "D) A curve instead of a line"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) Shallower",
      "explanation": "Doubling R halves G = 1/R. Since the slope on the v-i plane is G, the line becomes shallower."

      "correctAnswer": "C) Bilaterality",
      "explanation": "A bilateral device has f(v,i) = f(-v,-i), meaning the curve is symmetric about the origin."

        "D) Obeying KVL"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) Being memoryless",
      "explanation": "A resistor is memoryless: its current depends only on the voltage at that instant. A capacitor's current depends on dv/dt (rate of change), giving it memory."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) 3.33 mS",
      "explanation": "In series, R_total = R1 + R2 = 300 ohm, so G_total = 1/300 S = 3.33 mS"
