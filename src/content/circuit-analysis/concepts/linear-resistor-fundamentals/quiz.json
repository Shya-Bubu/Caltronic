            ],
            "correctAnswer": "25.5mA",
            "explanation": "Use I = V/R = 12V / 470Ω = 0.0255A = 25.5mA. Remember to convert to milliamps at the end!"

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "20Ω",
            "explanation": "Use P = I²R, so R = P/I² = 5W/(0.5A)² = 5/0.25 = 20Ω. When you have P and I, this is the fastest formula!"

            "correctAnswer": "2200Ω",
            "explanation": "kilo (k) means ×1000, so 2.2kΩ = 2.2 × 1000Ω = 2200Ω. This is a very common source of errors!"

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "The V-I graph is a straight line through the origin",
            "explanation": "Linearity means the relationship between cause (Voltage) and effect (Current) is proportional, i.e., I ∝ V. Graphically, this is a straight line passing through (0,0)."
