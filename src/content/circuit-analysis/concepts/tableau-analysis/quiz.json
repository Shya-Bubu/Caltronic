            ],
            "correctAnswer": "13",
            "explanation": "The tableau unknown vector x = [v_b; i_b; e] has 2b + (n−1) = 2(5) + 3 = 13 unknowns."

            "options": [
                "Branch constitutive equations",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "KCL equations",
            "explanation": "KCL is written as A · i_b = 0, directly using the reduced incidence matrix A."
        },
        {
            "id": "ta-q3",

            "correctAnswer": "−Aᵀ (negative transpose of incidence matrix)",
            "explanation": "The KVL row of the tableau matrix is [I_b | 0 | −Aᵀ], so the block multiplying the node voltages e is −Aᵀ."

            "id": "ta-q4",
            "prompt": "How does tableau analysis handle an ideal voltage source V_s in branch k?",
            "options": [
                "It adds a super-node equation",
                "It replaces the branch with a short circuit",
                "It writes v_k = V_s as the branch constitutive equation, leaving i_k as a free unknown",
                "It converts the source to a Norton equivalent first"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "It writes v_k = V_s as the branch constitutive equation, leaving i_k as a free unknown",
            "explanation": "Tableau analysis simply writes v_k = V_s as the branch equation. The current i_k is determined by the rest of the system through KCL/KVL — no special tricks are needed."

                "M_v is all zeros for this row; M_i has 1 on the diagonal and −β in column j",
                "M_v has −β in column j; M_i has 1 on the diagonal",
                "Both M_v and M_i have entries in column j"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "M_v is all zeros for this row; M_i has 1 on the diagonal and −β in column j",
            "explanation": "A CCCS branch equation is i_k − β·i_j = 0. This involves only currents, so M_v row is all zeros, and the M_i row has +1 at column k (diagonal) and −β at column j."

                "When all elements are resistors",
                "When det(T) ≠ 0 (T is nonsingular)",

            "correctAnswer": "When det(T) ≠ 0 (T is nonsingular)",
            "explanation": "The linear tableau system has a unique solution if and only if the tableau matrix T is nonsingular, i.e., det(T) ≠ 0."

            "options": [
                "All three sets become nonlinear",
                "Only the branch constitutive equations remain linear",
                "KCL and KVL remain linear; only branch equations may be nonlinear",
                "Only KCL remains linear"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "KCL and KVL remain linear; only branch equations may be nonlinear",
            "explanation": "KCL (A·i_b = 0) and KVL (v_b − Aᵀ·e = 0) are topological equations that depend only on the graph structure, not element physics. They are always linear. Only branch constitutive equations can be nonlinear."

            "id": "ta-q8",

            "correctAnswer": "Newton-Raphson iteration",
            "explanation": "Newton-Raphson iteration linearises the system around the current guess using the Jacobian J(x), solving J·Δx = −F(x) at each step. This is the standard approach used in SPICE."

            "id": "ta-q9",
            "prompt": "What is one key disadvantage of tableau analysis compared to nodal analysis?",
            "options": [
                "It cannot handle current sources",
                "The system size is larger: (2b + n − 1) vs (n − 1)",
                "It requires nonlinear solvers even for linear circuits",
                "It cannot accommodate resistive elements"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "The system size is larger: (2b + n − 1) vs (n − 1)",
            "explanation": "The tableau system has 2b + n − 1 unknowns, while nodal analysis has only n − 1 unknowns. For large circuits, this size difference is significant, which is why Modified Nodal Analysis (MNA) is preferred in practice."

            "id": "ta-q10",
            "prompt": "An ideal transformer with turns ratio n coupling branches p and s contributes how many constitutive equations to the tableau system?",

                "Two: v_p − n·v_s = 0 and n·i_p + i_s = 0",
                "Three: one each for voltage, current, and power",
                "None — it is handled purely by KCL/KVL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Two: v_p − n·v_s = 0 and n·i_p + i_s = 0",
            "explanation": "An ideal transformer contributes two coupled branch constitutive equations: the voltage relation v_p = n·v_s and the current relation n·i_p + i_s = 0. Both are needed to fully specify the transformer behaviour."
