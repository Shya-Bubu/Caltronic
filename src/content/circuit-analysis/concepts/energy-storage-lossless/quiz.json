            ],
            "correctAnswer": "125 μJ",
            "explanation": "E = ½CV² = ½ × 10×10⁻⁶ × 25 = 125 μJ. Remember the ½ factor!"

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "9 mJ",
            "explanation": "E = ½Li² = ½ × 2×10⁻³ × 9 = 9 mJ. Energy is proportional to current squared."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Net energy entering C or L is zero",
            "explanation": "Since q(t) = q(t+T), the integral ∫v·dq from q₁ to q₁ = 0. Energy is borrowed and returned each cycle — no net consumption."

            "explanation": "w_C = ∫v(q)dq depends only on q₁ and q₂, not on v(t) or i(t). This is the mathematical essence of being lossless."

            "correctAnswer": "Zero",
            "explanation": "The lossless property ensures zero average power. V and I are 90° out of phase, so average P = VIcos(90°) = 0."

            "correctAnswer": "Equivalent series resistance (ESR) dissipates I²·ESR",
            "explanation": "Real capacitors have parasitic resistance (ESR) in leads and dielectric. This small resistance dissipates power as heat, especially at high ripple currents."
