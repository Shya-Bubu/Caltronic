# Exam Guide: Energy Storage and Lossless Property

## Typical Questions
| Pattern | Marks | Time |
|---------|-------|------|
| **Calculate stored energy** | 2-3 | 2 min |
| **Prove lossless property** | 5-7 | 8 min |
| **Energy balance in circuit** | 5-8 | 8 min |

## Common Mistakes
- **Forgetting ½**: E = ½CV², NOT CV². The ½ comes from integrating v·dq = (q/C)dq.
- **Using wrong units**: Capacitance in farads, not μF, when computing energy in joules.
- **Confusing average and instantaneous power**: Instantaneous power oscillates; average power over one period is zero for ideal C/L.
