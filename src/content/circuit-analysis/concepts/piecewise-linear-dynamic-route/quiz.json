            "options": [
                "The circuit's power consumption",
                "The path traced by the operating point on the PWL characteristic",

            "correctAnswer": "The path traced by the operating point on the PWL characteristic",
            "explanation": "The dynamic route includes both the path (which segment) and direction (which way the operating point moves) on the piecewise-linear characteristic."

            "correctAnswer": "Identify the initial operating point on the characteristic",
            "explanation": "You first locate where the operating point starts on the PWL characteristic using v_C(t₀). This determines which segment is initially active."

            "correctAnswer": "The sign of dv_C/dt = i_C/C",
            "explanation": "If i_C > 0, then dv_C/dt > 0 and v_C increases (moves right). If i_C < 0, v_C decreases (moves left). The current tells you the direction."

            "correctAnswer": "Capacitor voltage v_C (or inductor current i_L)",
            "explanation": "By the continuity property, v_C(T⁺) = v_C(T⁻). The jump is horizontal on the v-i plane (same v, different i). For RL circuits, i_L is preserved."

            "explanation": "With zero input (x_s = 0), the circuit's response is purely the decay of its initial stored energy: x(t) = x(t₀)·e^(−(t−t₀)/τ). This is the 'natural response.'"

            "correctAnswer": "Unstable — grows exponentially",
            "explanation": "Negative τ means e^(−t/τ) = e^(+t/|τ|) → exponential growth. The operating point is repelled from equilibrium and reaches the segment boundary quickly. This is common in circuits with negative resistance regions (tunnel diodes, positive-feedback op-amps)."
