            "prompt": "The capacitor voltage continuity property states that:",
            "options": [
                "v_C always equals the source voltage",
                "v_C(T⁺) = v_C(T⁻) when current is bounded",
                "v_C can jump at any time",
                "v_C equals zero at switching instants"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "v_C(T⁺) = v_C(T⁻) when current is bounded",
            "explanation": "When the current through a capacitor remains bounded (finite), the voltage cannot change instantaneously. This follows from v(T+dt)−v(T) = (1/C)∫i·dt → 0 as dt → 0."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "3 A (continuity)",
            "explanation": "By inductor current continuity: i_L(0⁺) = i_L(0⁻) = 3A. The current cannot jump. The new circuit determines how i_L changes FOR t > 0, but at t = 0⁺, it equals its pre-switch value."

            "correctAnswer": "Infinite height, zero width, unit area",
            "explanation": "The impulse δ(t) is the limit of progressively narrower, taller pulses whose area remains exactly 1. It's zero everywhere except t=0 where it's singular, and ∫δ(t)dt = 1."

            "explanation": "v_C = (1/C)∫Aδ(τ)dτ = A/C for t > 0. The impulse deposits charge A instantaneously, raising the voltage by A/C = q/C."

            "correctAnswer": "The pulse area (= CE)",
            "explanation": "The height goes to infinity and width to zero, but their product (the area = CE) stays constant. This constant area becomes the 'strength' of the impulse."

            "correctAnswer": "v = L·di/dt becomes very large when i changes rapidly",
            "explanation": "When a switch opens, di/dt is extremely large (current forced to zero quickly). v = L·di/dt produces a very high voltage spike across the switch gap, ionizing the air and causing an arc."

            "correctAnswer": "Replace a capacitor/inductor with an equivalent voltage or current source",
            "explanation": "If the circuit has a unique solution v̂(t) across a port, the element at that port can be replaced by a source v̂(t) without affecting the rest of the circuit. This is essential for solving first-order circuits."

            "correctAnswer": "3 V",
            "explanation": "By the continuity property, v_C(0⁺) = v_C(0⁻) = 3V. The capacitor voltage at the instant just after switching equals the voltage just before switching, regardless of the new circuit topology."

            "explanation": "By the defining property: ∫₋ε^ε Aδ(t)dt = A for any ε > 0. So ∫₋₁¹ 5δ(t)dt = 5. The coefficient A scales the impulse strength."
