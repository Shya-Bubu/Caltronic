            "correctAnswer": "The Jacobian matrix with entries J_ij = ∂f_i/∂x_j",
            "explanation": "J is the Jacobian matrix whose (i,j) entry is ∂f_i/∂x_j. It generalises the scalar derivative f'(x) to multiple dimensions. In the scalar case x^(j+1) = x^(j) - f/f', the role of f' is replaced by J in the vector case."
