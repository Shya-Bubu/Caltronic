        {
            "id": "na-q1",
            "prompt": "A circuit has 4 non-reference nodes and 7 branches (all resistors and current sources). How many node voltage unknowns does nodal analysis require?",
            "options": [
                "7",
                "4",
                "14",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "4",
            "explanation": "Nodal analysis defines one voltage variable per non-reference node. With 4 non-reference nodes, there are 4 unknowns (e₁, e₂, e₃, e₄), regardless of the number of branches."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "5 S",

            "correctAnswer": "40/26 ≈ 1.538 V",
            "explanation": "By Cramer's rule: e₁ = det([[6,−2],[2,6]]) / 26 = (36+4)/26 = 40/26 ≈ 1.538 V."

            "correctAnswer": "+1 in row 3, −1 in row 1",
            "explanation": "The convention is: +1 at the 'from' node (branch leaves node 3) and −1 at the 'to' node (branch enters node 1). Rows for nodes not involved get 0."

            "correctAnswer": "[0, +1, 0]ᵀ (for a 3-node circuit)",
            "explanation": "The branch leaves node 2 so row 2 gets +1. It enters ground (node 0), but the ground row is excluded from the reduced incidence matrix. All other rows are 0."

            "explanation": "Nonlinear node equations require iterative methods. Newton–Raphson linearizes f(e) around a current estimate and iteratively converges to a solution. Cramer's rule and LU decomposition apply only to linear systems."
