            "options": [
                "As a short circuit",
                "As an open circuit (zero current)",

            "prompt": "What is the voltage drop across an ideal diode when it is conducting (ON)?",
            "options": [
                "0.7 V",
                "0 V",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "0 V",
            "explanation": "Since an ideal diode has zero resistance when conducting, Ohm's law implies that the voltage drop across it must be exactly zero volts regardless of current."

            "correctAnswer": "It blocks it completely",
            "explanation": "By definition, an ideal diode allows current to flow in only one direction (the direction of the arrow). It physically prevents any negative (reverse) current flow."

            "correctAnswer": "Anode is connected to positive terminal",
            "explanation": "For the diode to turn ON (forward bias), the anode must be at a higher potential than the cathode. Connecting the anode to the positive source terminal satisfies this."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "No, never",
            "explanation": "When ON, voltage is zero (P=0*I=0). When OFF, current is zero (P=V*0=0). Thus, an ideal diode never dissipates power."

            "correctAnswer": "0 V",
            "explanation": "Unlike real silicon diodes which have a threshold of ~0.7V, the ideal diode model assumes conduction begins immediately as the voltage becomes positive, i.e., at 0V."
