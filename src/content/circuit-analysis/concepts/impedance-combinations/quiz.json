            "explanation": "Series impedances add directly, just like resistors in series in DC circuits. The same current flows through each, so V_total = (Z₁ + Z₂ + ...)I."

            "explanation": "Z = R + j(ωL - 1/ωC). This is purely real when ωL = 1/(ωC), i.e., ω₀ = 1/√(LC). This is the resonant frequency, where the circuit behaves as a pure resistor."
