      "options": [
        "A) Make nonlinear curves more accurate",
        "B) Replace nonlinear curves with straight-line segments so linear analysis applies within each segment",
        "C) Convert AC circuits to DC",
        "D) Eliminate all nonlinear elements from a circuit"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) Replace nonlinear curves with straight-line segments so linear analysis applies within each segment",
      "explanation": "PWL approximation replaces smooth nonlinear curves with connected straight-line segments. Within each segment, the element behaves linearly, enabling standard linear circuit analysis."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) Voltage-controlled PWL element",
      "explanation": "The concave resistor gives a unique current for each voltage (single-valued i-hat(v)), making it voltage-controlled. It has two segments with a breakpoint at v = E."

        "D) An ideal diode"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) The convex resistor",
      "explanation": "The convex resistor (v = 0 for i <= J, v = R(i-J) for i > J) is the exact dual of the concave resistor, with voltage and current roles swapped."

        "D) Voltage sources in series"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) A current source + linear conductance + concave resistors in parallel",
      "explanation": "The decomposition theorem states that any voltage-controlled PWL curve equals I0 + G0*v + sum of concave resistor contributions, which is a parallel combination of a current source, linear conductance, and concave resistors."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) G1 = 0.6, G2 = 1.5",
      "explanation": "G1 = 0.8 - 0.2 = 0.6 (slope change at first breakpoint). G2 = 2.3 - 0.8 = 1.5 (slope change at second breakpoint). These are incremental changes, not absolute slopes."

      "options": [
        "A) Immediately accept the answer",

        "C) Solve for all regions simultaneously",
        "D) Check that the power is positive"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) Verify that the solution falls within the assumed region's bounds",
      "explanation": "Consistency checking is essential. If the solution (e.g., a diode voltage) falls outside the assumed region, the assumption was wrong and you must try a different region."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) i = 0 for v < V_gamma, and i = Gd(v - V_gamma) for v >= V_gamma",
      "explanation": "The standard 2-segment model replaces the exponential with: off (zero current below V_gamma ~ 0.7V) and on (linear with conductance Gd above V_gamma). This is a single concave resistor."

        "D) Only ideal diodes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) Convex resistors in series (plus voltage source and linear resistance)",
      "explanation": "By duality: voltage-controlled PWL uses concave in parallel, so current-controlled PWL uses convex resistors in series, plus a voltage source V0 and linear resistance R0."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) 4",
      "explanation": "Each diode has 2 states (on or off). With 2 diodes: 2 x 2 = 4 possible combinations. In practice, many can be eliminated quickly, but the maximum is 4."

        "C) Negative",
        "D) Undefined"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) Negative",
      "explanation": "Gk = (slope of next segment) - (slope of current segment). If the slope decreases, the difference is negative. This occurs in models with negative resistance regions, such as a PWL tunnel diode model."
