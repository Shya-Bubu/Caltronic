    {
      "id": "q1",
      "prompt": "The v-i characteristic of an ideal diode consists of:",
      "options": [
        "A) A straight line through the origin",
        "B) An exponential curve",
        "C) The negative v-axis and the positive i-axis",
        "D) The positive v-axis and the negative i-axis"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) The negative v-axis and the positive i-axis",
      "explanation": "The ideal diode has i = 0 for v < 0 (negative v-axis) and v = 0 for i > 0 (positive i-axis). These two segments meet at the origin."

        "D) A linear resistor"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) A short circuit",
      "explanation": "In forward conduction, v = 0 and current flows freely. This is exactly the behaviour of a short circuit."

      "prompt": "When an ideal diode is reverse biased, it behaves as:",
      "options": [
        "A) A short circuit",
        "B) A 0.7V voltage source",
        "C) An open circuit",
        "D) A negative resistor"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) An open circuit",
      "explanation": "In reverse bias, i = 0 regardless of the (negative) voltage. This is exactly the behaviour of an open circuit."

      "prompt": "A 10V source is in series with a 2 kohm resistor and an ideal diode (forward direction). The current is:",
      "options": [

        "B) 5 mA",
        "C) 10 mA",
        "D) 14.3 mA"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) 5 mA",
      "explanation": "Assuming forward conduction: diode = short circuit. i = V/R = 10/2000 = 5 mA. Check: i = 5 mA > 0, consistent. Answer is 5 mA."
    },
    {
      "id": "q5",
      "prompt": "A -3V source is in series with a 1 kohm resistor and an ideal diode (forward direction). The current is:",

        "C) 0 mA",
        "D) Cannot be determined"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) 0 mA",
      "explanation": "Try forward conduction: i = -3/1000 = -3 mA < 0. Inconsistent. Try reverse bias: i = 0, v_diode = -3V < 0. Consistent. So i = 0 mA."
    },
    {
      "id": "q6",
      "prompt": "The first step in analysing an ideal diode circuit is:",
      "options": [
        "A) Write KVL equations with the diode equation",
        "B) Assume a state (conducting or blocking) for each diode",
        "C) Calculate the power dissipated in the diode",
        "D) Apply superposition"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) Assume a state (conducting or blocking) for each diode",
      "explanation": "The assume-and-check method begins by assuming each diode is either forward conducting (short) or reverse biased (open), then solving the resulting linear circuit and checking consistency."
    },
    {
      "id": "q7",
      "prompt": "You assumed a diode is forward conducting and found i = -2 mA through it. What should you conclude?",
      "options": [
        "A) The assumption is correct; current is -2 mA",
        "B) The assumption is wrong; try reverse biased instead",
        "C) The diode is in breakdown",
        "D) The circuit has no valid solution"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) The assumption is wrong; try reverse biased instead",
      "explanation": "Forward conduction requires i >= 0. Finding i = -2 mA < 0 means the forward-conducting assumption is inconsistent. You must try reverse biased."

    {
      "id": "q8",
      "prompt": "How much power does an ideal diode absorb?",
      "options": [
        "A) p = 0.7 * i",
        "B) Zero in both modes",
        "C) Positive when forward biased",
        "D) Depends on the circuit"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) Zero in both modes",
      "explanation": "In reverse bias, i = 0 so p = vi = 0. In forward conduction, v = 0 so p = vi = 0. The ideal diode absorbs zero power in both modes."
    },
    {
      "id": "q9",
      "prompt": "A circuit has two ideal diodes in parallel with opposite polarities, connected to a 5V source through a resistor. How many diodes conduct?",
      "options": [
        "A) Both conduct",
        "B) Neither conducts",
        "C) Exactly one conducts",
        "D) Cannot be determined without the resistor value"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) Exactly one conducts",
      "explanation": "With opposite polarities, one diode is forward biased and one is reverse biased for a given source polarity. The forward-biased one conducts (short circuit), forcing v = 0 across both. The other sees v = 0, which is consistent with reverse bias. So exactly one conducts."

      "options": [
        "A) It has no forward voltage drop",
        "B) It cannot conduct current",
        "C) It has infinite reverse leakage",
        "D) It is a linear device"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A) It has no forward voltage drop",
      "explanation": "The ideal diode sets the turn-on voltage to zero (no 0.7V drop). It captures the switching behaviour (block vs conduct) without modelling the gradual turn-on of a real semiconductor diode."
