    {
      "id": "q1",
      "prompt": "A 500-ohm resistor carries 20 mA. What power does it absorb?",
      "options": [
        "A) 10 mW",
        "B) 200 mW",
        "C) 0.2 W",
        "D) 5 W"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) 200 mW",
      "explanation": "p = R * i^2 = 500 * (0.02)^2 = 500 * 0.0004 = 0.2 W = 200 mW."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "prompt": "A resistor has R = -50 ohm. When i = 0.1 A, the power absorbed is:",
      "options": [
        "A) +0.5 W",
        "B) -0.5 W",
        "C) +5 W",
        "D) -5 W"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) -0.5 W",
      "explanation": "p = R * i^2 = (-50)(0.1)^2 = (-50)(0.01) = -0.5 W. The negative sign means it delivers 0.5 W."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "prompt": "A device's v-i characteristic lies entirely in the first and third quadrants. The device is:",
      "options": [
        "A) Active",
        "B) Passive",
        "C) Linear",
        "D) Nonlinear"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) Passive",
      "explanation": "A characteristic in the closed first and third quadrants means p = vi >= 0 at every operating point, which is the definition of a passive device."
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "prompt": "In which quadrant(s) of the v-i plane is p = vi negative?",
      "options": [
        "A) I and III",
        "B) II and IV",
        "C) I and IV",
        "D) II and III"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) II and IV",
      "explanation": "In quadrant II: v < 0, i > 0, so vi < 0. In quadrant IV: v > 0, i < 0, so vi < 0. These are the active regions."

    {
      "id": "q5",
      "prompt": "Which of these three power formulas is INCORRECT for a linear resistor?",

        "B) p = Ri^2",
        "C) p = Gv^2",
        "D) p = Rv^2"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D) p = Rv^2",
      "explanation": "p = Rv^2 is incorrect. The correct forms are p = vi, p = Ri^2, and p = Gv^2 (= v^2/R)."

    {
      "id": "q6",
      "prompt": "A linear resistor with R > 0 can deliver energy to the circuit.",
      "options": [
        "A) True, if the current is large enough",
        "B) True, if the voltage is negative",
        "C) False, it always absorbs energy",
        "D) False, but only for DC circuits"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) False, it always absorbs energy",
      "explanation": "With R > 0, p = Ri^2 >= 0 always. The resistor always absorbs energy (or absorbs zero when i = 0). It can never deliver energy."
    },
    {
      "id": "q7",
      "prompt": "A nonlinear resistor has the characteristic i = v^3. Is it passive?",
      "options": [
        "A) Yes, because the curve stays in quadrants I and III",
        "B) No, because it is nonlinear",
        "C) No, because it enters quadrant II",
        "D) Cannot be determined without more information"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A) Yes, because the curve stays in quadrants I and III",
      "explanation": "For i = v^3: when v > 0, i > 0 (quadrant I). When v < 0, i < 0 (quadrant III). The curve stays in I and III, so p = vi >= 0 everywhere. The device is passive."

    {
      "id": "q8",
      "prompt": "A tunnel diode has a region where increasing v causes decreasing i. This region is called:",
      "options": [
        "A) Forward bias region",
        "B) Breakdown region",
        "C) Negative differential resistance region",
        "D) Passive region"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) Negative differential resistance region",
      "explanation": "When di/dv < 0 (increasing voltage causes decreasing current), the device exhibits negative differential resistance. This is a hallmark of certain active devices like tunnel diodes."

    {
      "id": "q9",
      "prompt": "Power absorbed by a 2 kohm resistor with 10V across it is:",
      "options": [
        "A) 5 mW",
        "B) 50 mW",
        "C) 20 mW",
        "D) 200 mW"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) 50 mW",
      "explanation": "p = Gv^2 = (1/R)v^2 = (1/2000)(10)^2 = 100/2000 = 0.05 W = 50 mW."

        "A) Absorbing 6W",
        "B) Delivering 6W",
        "C) Absorbing 1W",
        "D) Neither absorbing nor delivering"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) Delivering 6W",
      "explanation": "p = vi = (3)(-2) = -6 W. Since p < 0, the element delivers 6W to the rest of the circuit (operating in quadrant IV: v > 0, i < 0)."
