            "options": [
                "The element is absorbing power",
                "The element is broken",

            "correctAnswer": "The element is supplying power",
            "explanation": "If the calculated power is negative (P < 0), it implies that the actual direction of energy flow is leaving the component, meaning it is supplying power."

            "correctAnswer": "No, it always absorbs power",
            "explanation": "Resistors are inherently passive devices that dissipate electrical energy as heat, so the power absorbed by a resistor is always a positive value."

            "explanation": "To modify the formula P = VI for a resistor using Ohm's Law (V = IR), replace V to get P = (IR)I = I²R, or replace I to get P = V(V/R) = V²/R."
