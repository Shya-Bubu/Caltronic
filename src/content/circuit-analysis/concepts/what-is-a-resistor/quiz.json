    {
      "id": "q1",
      "prompt": "In circuit theory, which of the following is the correct definition of a two-terminal resistor?",
      "options": [
        "A) A physical component that obeys Ohm's law with a fixed resistance R",
        "B) Any two-terminal element whose voltage and current satisfy f(v, i) = 0",
        "C) A component that always dissipates power as heat",
        "D) A device with resistance measured in ohms"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) Any two-terminal element whose voltage and current satisfy f(v, i) = 0",
      "explanation": "In circuit theory, a resistor is defined generally as any two-terminal element with a v-i relationship f(v, i) = 0. This includes nonlinear devices, sources, and more."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "prompt": "Which of the following is NOT a two-terminal resistor in circuit theory?",
      "options": [
        "A) An ideal diode",
        "B) A DC voltage source",
        "C) A three-terminal transistor",
        "D) An open circuit"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) A three-terminal transistor",
      "explanation": "A transistor has three terminals, so it is not a two-terminal resistor. All the other options have exactly two terminals and a v-i relationship."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "prompt": "The v-i characteristic of a device is described by the set R = {(v, i) : v - i^3 = 0}. Is this a resistor in circuit theory?",
      "options": [
        "A) No, because the relationship is nonlinear",
        "B) No, because it doesn't obey Ohm's law",
        "C) Yes, because voltage and current satisfy f(v, i) = 0",
        "D) Yes, but only if R is positive"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) Yes, because voltage and current satisfy f(v, i) = 0",
      "explanation": "Any two-terminal element whose v and i satisfy f(v, i) = 0 is a resistor. Linearity is not required. Here f(v, i) = v - i^3 = 0 qualifies."
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "prompt": "On the v-i plane, which variable is on the horizontal axis?",
      "options": [
        "A) Current i",
        "B) Voltage v",
        "C) Power p",
        "D) Resistance R"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) Voltage v",
      "explanation": "By convention, in the 'v-i plane', the first variable (v) is the horizontal axis (abscissa) and the second variable (i) is the vertical axis (ordinate)."

    {
      "id": "q5",
      "prompt": "A DC current source supplies i = 5A regardless of the voltage across it. In circuit theory, this device is:",
      "options": [
        "A) Not a resistor because its current is constant",
        "B) A linear resistor with infinite resistance",
        "C) A two-terminal resistor with characteristic i = 5 for all v",
        "D) An active element that cannot be classified as a resistor"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) A two-terminal resistor with characteristic i = 5 for all v",
      "explanation": "A DC current source has f(v, i) = i - 5 = 0, which satisfies the general resistor definition. Its v-i characteristic is a horizontal line at i = 5."
    },
    {
      "id": "q6",
      "prompt": "What distinguishes a time-varying resistor from a time-invariant one?",
      "options": [
        "A) A time-varying resistor is nonlinear; a time-invariant one is linear",
        "B) A time-varying resistor's v-i relationship changes with time",
        "C) A time-varying resistor can only carry AC current",
        "D) There is no difference; all resistors are time-invariant"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) A time-varying resistor's v-i relationship changes with time",
      "explanation": "A time-varying resistor has a v-i relationship that depends on time, e.g., v(t) = R(t) * i(t) where R(t) changes. A time-invariant resistor has a fixed v-i relationship."
    },
    {
      "id": "q7",
      "prompt": "If you reflect the v-i characteristic of a resistor about the line v = i (the 45-degree line through the origin), what do you obtain?",
      "options": [
        "A) The i-v characteristic of the same resistor",
        "B) The v-i characteristic of its dual resistor",
        "C) The power characteristic of the resistor",
        "D) The inverse resistance"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) The v-i characteristic of its dual resistor",
      "explanation": "Reflecting about the 45-degree line swaps the v and i axes, which transforms the v-i representation into the i-v representation. The dual resistor's v-i characteristic in the v-i plane equals the original resistor's characteristic in the i-v plane."

    {
      "id": "q8",
      "prompt": "Which statement best explains why the broad circuit theory definition of 'resistor' is practically useful?",
      "options": [
        "A) It simplifies manufacturing of physical resistors",
        "B) Analysis techniques developed for resistors apply to all two-terminal devices",
        "C) It eliminates the need to use Ohm's law",
        "D) It makes nonlinear devices behave linearly"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) Analysis techniques developed for resistors apply to all two-terminal devices",
      "explanation": "The practical power of the broad definition is that series/parallel rules, graphical analysis, and other resistor analysis techniques apply to any device classified as a resistor, not just linear ones."

    {
      "id": "q9",
      "prompt": "A device has the v-i characteristic: v = 0 for i > 0, and i = 0 for v < 0. What type of resistor is this?",
      "options": [
        "A) A linear resistor",
        "B) A short circuit",
        "C) An ideal diode",
        "D) An open circuit"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) An ideal diode",
      "explanation": "This describes the ideal diode: when forward biased (i > 0), the voltage is zero (acts as short circuit); when reverse biased (v < 0), the current is zero (acts as open circuit)."

    {
      "id": "q10",
      "prompt": "The characteristic R = {(v, i) : v = 3.3V for all i} describes which device?",

        "C) A DC voltage source of 3.3V",
        "D) An open circuit with 3.3V across it"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) A DC voltage source of 3.3V",
      "explanation": "If v = 3.3V regardless of the current, the device maintains a constant voltage. This is the definition of an ideal DC voltage source. Its v-i characteristic is a vertical line at v = 3.3 on the v-i plane."
