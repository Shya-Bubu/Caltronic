    {
      "id": "q1",
      "prompt": "In a parallel connection of two resistors, KVL forces:",
      "options": [
        "A) The currents to be equal: i = i1 = i2",
        "B) The voltages to be equal: v = v1 = v2",
        "C) The resistances to be equal: R1 = R2",
        "D) The powers to be equal: p1 = p2"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) The voltages to be equal: v = v1 = v2",
      "explanation": "In a parallel connection, both elements share the same pair of nodes, so KVL forces v = v1 = v2."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "prompt": "In a parallel connection, KCL gives:",
      "options": [
        "A) v = v1 + v2",

        "C) i = i1 + i2",
        "D) i = max(i1, i2)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) i = i1 + i2",
      "explanation": "KCL at the common node gives i = i1 + i2. The port current is the sum of the individual branch currents."

      "id": "q3",
      "prompt": "Two voltage-controlled resistors in parallel yield a result that is:",
      "options": [
        "A) Current-controlled",
        "B) Voltage-controlled",
        "C) Neither",
        "D) Depends on the specific functions"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) Voltage-controlled",
      "explanation": "Since v = v1 = v2 by KVL, i = i-hat1(v) + i-hat2(v) is a single-valued function of v. The result is voltage-controlled."
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "prompt": "Graphical parallel addition means, at each voltage value:",
      "options": [

        "D) Take the minimum of the currents"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) Add the currents from each curve (vertical stacking)",
      "explanation": "Parallel addition adds currents at equal voltage. In the v-i plane, this is vertical stacking: at each horizontal position (voltage), add the heights (currents)."

        "D) Capacitance C"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) Conductance G",
      "explanation": "In the duality table, resistance R is dual to conductance G. The linear Ohm's law v = Ri becomes the dual i = Gv."

        "C) A current source",
        "D) An open circuit"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) A current source",
      "explanation": "In the duality transformation, voltage sources become current sources, and vice versa."

      "options": [
        "A) Another open circuit",

        "C) A 1-ohm resistor",
        "D) A current source"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) A short circuit",
      "explanation": "An open circuit (i = 0 for all v) is dual to a short circuit (v = 0 for all i). The roles of zero current and zero voltage are swapped."

        "B) Parallel connection of voltage-controlled resistors is voltage-controlled",
        "C) Parallel connection of current-controlled resistors is current-controlled",
        "D) Series connection is always better than parallel"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) Parallel connection of voltage-controlled resistors is voltage-controlled",
      "explanation": "Apply the duality substitutions: series -> parallel, current-controlled -> voltage-controlled. The dual statement is: parallel connection of voltage-controlled resistors is voltage-controlled."

        "C) 3 ohm",
        "D) 1.5 ohm"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) 2 ohm",
      "explanation": "1/R_eq = 1/R1 + 1/R2 = 1/6 + 1/3 = 1/6 + 2/6 = 3/6 = 1/2. So R_eq = 2 ohm."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) Nodal analysis",
      "explanation": "Mesh and node are dual concepts. Mesh analysis (using KVL around loops with mesh currents) is dual to nodal analysis (using KCL at nodes with node voltages)."
