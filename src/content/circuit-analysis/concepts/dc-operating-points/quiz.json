      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B) The (v, i) pair at which the circuit operates under DC excitation",
      "explanation": "The DC operating point is the specific voltage-current pair that satisfies all circuit constraints (KCL, KVL, and element equations) simultaneously under DC conditions."

      "id": "q2",
      "prompt": "A circuit with only linear passive resistors and a single DC source has:",

        "D) v = 0"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) v = Eb",
      "explanation": "Setting i = 0 in the load-line equation i = (Eb - v)/Rb gives v = Eb. The load line crosses the voltage axis at v = Eb."

        "C) Two",
        "D) Three"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) Two",
      "explanation": "Setting 4v^2 = 8 - 4v gives 4v^2 + 4v - 8 = 0, i.e., v^2 + v - 2 = 0. The discriminant is 1 + 8 = 9 > 0, so there are two real solutions: v = 1 and v = -2."

      "correctAnswer": "C) i = 4 A",
      "explanation": "Substituting v = 1 into the device equation: i = 4(1)^2 = 4 A. Alternatively, from the load line: i = 8 - 4(1) = 4 A. Both give 4 A."

        "D) Oscillates"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C) Has no DC operating point",
      "explanation": "No intersection means no (v, i) pair satisfies both the device equation and the load-line equation simultaneously. The circuit has no valid DC operating point under the given model."
