            "id": "q1",
            "prompt": "What is the impedance of a resistor in the phasor domain?",
            "options": [
                "A) jωR",
                "B) R",
                "C) 1/(jωR)",
                "D) R∠90°"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "B) R",
            "explanation": "The resistor's V-I relationship v = Ri is purely algebraic (no derivatives). In phasor form, V = RI, so Z_R = R — a real number. No phase shift occurs."

                "C) ωL",
                "D) 1/(jωL)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "A) jωL",
            "explanation": "From v = L·di/dt, the derivative property gives V = jωL·I, so Z_L = jωL. It's purely imaginary with a positive value, meaning voltage leads current by 90°."

            "correctAnswer": "C) 1/(jωC)",
            "explanation": "From i = C·dv/dt, we get I = jωC·V, so V = (1/jωC)·I. The impedance Z_C = 1/(jωC) = -j/(ωC) is purely imaginary and negative."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "B) Voltage leads current by 90°",
            "explanation": "ELI: E (voltage) L (inductor) I (current) — voltage leads current. Since Z_L = jωL = ωL∠90°, the voltage phasor is 90° ahead of the current phasor."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "B) Short circuit",
            "explanation": "Z_L = jωL = j(0)L = 0. An impedance of zero is a short circuit. At DC, the inductor has no opposition to current flow — only changing currents create voltage."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "B) Open circuit",
            "explanation": "Z_C = 1/(jωC) = 1/(j·0·C) → ∞. Infinite impedance means open circuit. At DC, the capacitor is fully charged and no current flows."

            "correctAnswer": "C) Ohms (Ω)",
            "explanation": "Impedance is measured in Ohms (Ω), the same unit as resistance. Even though impedance can be complex, the unit remains Ohms."

            "correctAnswer": "C) Reactance",
            "explanation": "X is the reactance — the imaginary part of impedance. Positive X is inductive reactance (X_L = ωL); negative X is capacitive reactance (X_C = -1/ωC)."

            "correctAnswer": "B) Y = 1/Z",
            "explanation": "Admittance Y = 1/Z = I/V. It's the reciprocal of impedance, measured in Siemens (S). The relationship I = YV is analogous to I = GV for conductance."

            "explanation": "ω = 2πf = 2π(1000) = 6283.2 rad/s. Z_L = jωL = j(6283.2)(0.05) = j314.16 Ω. Remember to use ω, not f, in the formula."

            "correctAnswer": "B) It represents energy storage, not dissipation — stored energy is returned each cycle",
            "explanation": "The imaginary part of impedance corresponds to elements that store energy (inductors in magnetic fields, capacitors in electric fields) and return it. The 90° phase shift means average power is zero — no energy is dissipated."
