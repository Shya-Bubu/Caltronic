# Synthesis: Two-Terminal Resistors

You've now covered the complete foundation of two-terminal resistor theory. Let's connect the dots.

## The Big Picture

At the start, we redefined what a "resistor" really means:

> **A resistor is any two-terminal element whose voltage and current satisfy some relationship f(v, i) = 0.**

This generalization takes us from the simple linear resistor (v = iR) to an entire universe of nonlinear devices: diodes, tunnel diodes, Zener diodes, and more.
