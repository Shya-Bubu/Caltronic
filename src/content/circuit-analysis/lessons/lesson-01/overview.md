# Lesson 01: Two-Terminal Resistors

Welcome to the very first lesson of Circuit Analysis. This is where everything begins.

In your A-Level physics course, you probably learned that a "resistor" is a component that obeys Ohm's law — you apply a voltage, a proportional current flows, and that's that. Simple, right?

Well, circuit theory takes a much broader view. In this lesson, you will discover that the word **resistor** means something far more general than what you've seen before. A "resistor" in circuit theory is any two-terminal device whose voltage and current are related by some equation — and that equation doesn't have to be a straight line. An ideal diode is a resistor. A battery is a resistor. Even a tunnel diode with its weird negative resistance region is a resistor.

This conceptual shift is one of the most important things you'll learn in this entire course. Once you understand that all these devices are just different types of resistors — each with their own v-i characteristic curve — the entire landscape of circuit analysis opens up.

## What You Will Learn

| Concept | Key Idea |
|---------|----------|
| What is a resistor? | The circuit theory definition vs the physics definition |
| Linear resistors & Ohm's law | The v-i and i-v planes, resistance R, conductance G |
| Open circuit, short circuit & duality | Special resistors and the powerful duality principle |
| Power & passivity | How to tell if a device supplies or absorbs energy |
| The ideal diode | A piecewise-linear nonlinear resistor |
| The PN-junction diode | The exponential model, thermal voltage |
| Tunnel diode & special devices | Current-controlled vs voltage-controlled devices |
| Series connections | How to find driving-point characteristics |
| Parallel connections & duality | Parallel analysis and the duality shortcut |
| PWL approximation | Approximating curves with straight-line segments |
| DC operating points | Graphical (load-line) analysis and multiple solutions |
| Transfer characteristics | Input-output relationships in resistor circuits |

## Why This Matters

Every analysis technique you will learn later in this course — nodal analysis, mesh analysis, Thevenin/Norton equivalents, transient analysis — all of them build on the foundation laid in this lesson. If you understand v-i characteristics deeply, the rest of the course becomes dramatically easier.

The concepts here also appear directly in your exam. Expect questions on: drawing and interpreting v-i curves, applying the graphical method to find operating points, and synthesising PWL characteristics from basic building blocks.

Take your time. Work through each concept carefully. Use the interactive diagrams. And remember: there is no such thing as a stupid question at this stage.
