            "correctAnswer": "Replacing complex quantities with simpler ones while accepting some error",
            "explanation": "Approximation is about trading accuracy for tractability. You replace something complex (infinite series, detailed physical model) with something simpler (truncated polynomial, ideal model), accepting that the result won't be exact."

            "correctAnswer": "sin(x) ≈ x − x³/6",
            "explanation": "The Taylor series of sin(x) around x = 0 is x − x³/3! + x⁵/5! − ... The 3rd-order approximation keeps terms up to x³: sin(x) ≈ x − x³/6. This is significantly more accurate than the 1st-order (x) for larger values of x."

            "options": [
                "Because it discretizes the voltage",

            "correctAnswer": "Because it ignores the exponential I-V relationship for a simpler model",
            "explanation": "The piecewise-linear model replaces the actual exponential I-V relationship with two simple rules: I = 0 for V < 0.7V, and I = (V − 0.7)/R for V ≥ 0.7V. This ignores the smooth exponential transition. It's model simplification — discarding physical detail for analytical tractability."

            "explanation": "The Leibniz alternating series π/4 = 1 − 1/3 + 1/5 − 1/7 + ... has error bounded by the first omitted term, which is approximately 1/N after N terms. This is very slow convergence — 1000 terms for 3 correct digits."

            "explanation": "All linearizations are approximations (you're replacing a nonlinear function with a simpler linear one). But not all approximations are linearizations — truncating a Taylor series to 5th order, rounding a number, or simplifying a model are approximations but not linearizations."

            "correctAnswer": "They're both truncating an infinite quantity, but with different error tolerances",
            "explanation": "π has infinitely many digits. Any finite representation is an approximation. The difference is the error tolerance — a bridge can tolerate 10⁻⁶ relative error, while GPS positioning requires 10⁻¹⁵. Same concept, different acceptable error."

            "correctAnswer": "Beyond a certain order, the approximation error becomes smaller than floating-point rounding error",
            "explanation": "Computers use finite-precision arithmetic (typically 64-bit doubles with ~16 significant digits). Once the Taylor truncation error drops below ~10⁻¹⁶, adding more terms contributes nothing because the result is limited by floating-point representation error."

            "correctAnswer": "Sampling an audio signal at 44.1 kHz",
            "explanation": "Sampling at 44.1 kHz is primarily discretization — converting a continuous-time signal into discrete samples. The other three are approximations: truncating an infinite series, simplifying a device model, and representing an irrational number with a rational one."

            "explanation": "The Taylor remainder theorem states that the error after N terms is at most |x|^(N+1)/(N+1)! for the sin(x) series. The factorial in the denominator is why higher-order Taylor approximations converge so rapidly — factorial growth dominates polynomial growth."

            "explanation": "The exact equation is I = Is(e^(V/Vt) − 1). For V >> Vt (about 26 mV at room temperature), e^(V/Vt) >> 1, so the −1 is negligible. Dropping it simplifies the math. But near V = 0, the −1 ensures I = 0 when V = 0, which the approximation gets wrong."
