            ],
            "correctAnswer": "−70 mV",
            "explanation": "At rest, the neuron maintains about −70 mV (inside negative relative to outside) due to the Na⁺/K⁺ pump and ion channel equilibria. The threshold for firing is about −55 mV, and the peak of the action potential reaches about +40 mV."

            "correctAnswer": "P(k) = (λt)^k e^(−λt) / k!",
            "explanation": "The Poisson distribution models random, independent events at constant rate λ. The parameter λt is the expected number of spikes. This model has no voltage dynamics — spikes are purely random events."

            "explanation": "The LIF is an RC circuit: Cm is the membrane capacitance, Rm is the leak resistance. Input current I(t) charges the capacitor, while the leak term Vm/Rm continuously discharges it. When V reaches threshold, a spike is registered and V resets."

            "explanation": "FHN reduces HH's 4 variables to 2: V (fast activator, captures the spike) and W (slow inhibitor/recovery variable). It captures excitability and oscillations qualitatively but not the exact spike shape or channel-level details."

            "explanation": "The LIF captures the essential integrate-leak-spike behavior with just a few parameters (Cm, Rm, Vth, Vreset). It's computationally cheap enough to simulate networks of millions of neurons in real-time, yet reproduces realistic firing statistics."

            "correctAnswer": "It includes mean reversion (leak toward resting potential)",
            "explanation": "The OU process adds a drift term −(V−μ)/τ that pulls V back toward the mean μ with time constant τ. This mimics the passive membrane leak: without input, the voltage decays back to rest. Pure diffusion (dV = μdt + σdW) has no such restoring force."

            "explanation": "g_Na is the maximum sodium conductance. m is the activation gate (opens rapidly during depolarization, cubed because 3 subunits must activate). h is the inactivation gate (closes more slowly, shutting off Na⁺ current). Together, m³h gives the transient Na⁺ current responsible for the spike's rising phase."

This is a signal processing perspective — the neuron is a filter! The kernels can be fitted to data without needing explicit ion channel models."
