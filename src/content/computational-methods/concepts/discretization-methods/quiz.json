            "correctAnswer": "Converting continuous-domain problems into discrete-point problems",
            "explanation": "Discretization changes the domain from continuous to discrete. You go from x(t) defined at every instant to x[n] defined only at sample times. The key attribute is creating a countable representation of something inherently continuous."

            "explanation": "The forward difference has O(h) error — it's first-order accurate. Halving h halves the error. This comes from the Taylor expansion: f(x+h) = f(x) + hf'(x) + h²f''(x)/2 + ..., so (f(x+h)−f(x))/h = f'(x) + O(h)."

            "explanation": "Each grid point is an unknown, and a 100×100 grid has 100 × 100 = 10,000 points (minus boundary points which are known, but the order of magnitude is 10,000). This gives a system of ~10,000 linear equations — large but solvable for modern computers."

            "correctAnswer": "It's more accurate for the same grid spacing h",
            "explanation": "Central differences use symmetric information (points on both sides), which cancels the leading error term by symmetry. For the same h, central differences are typically much more accurate. Forward differences are only used when boundary conditions prevent using the symmetric formula."

            "explanation": "The DFT produces N frequency bins from 0 to fs, spaced at intervals of Δf = fs/N. Want 1 Hz resolution with fs = 1000 Hz? You need N = 1000 samples. This is why longer recordings give finer frequency resolution."

                "Yes, always",

            "correctAnswer": "No — it gives the mathematical minimum; practical systems need some margin above Nyquist",
            "explanation": "The Nyquist rate (2·fmax) is the theoretical minimum. In practice, anti-aliasing filters are imperfect, so you sample somewhat above Nyquist. CD audio uses fs = 44.1 kHz for 20 kHz audio bandwidth — about 10% above the Nyquist minimum of 40 kHz."

            "correctAnswer": "Aliasing and discretization error",
            "explanation": "Discretization introduces aliasing (when sampling below Nyquist) and discretization error (from replacing continuous operations with discrete approximations, like derivatives with finite differences). These are fundamentally different from statistical error (random sampling) or linearization error (local validity)."
