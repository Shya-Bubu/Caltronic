            "prompt": "When is a computational approach preferred over an analytical approach?",
            "options": [
                "When the problem is simple enough to solve by hand",
                "When no closed-form analytical solution exists",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "When no closed-form analytical solution exists",
            "explanation": "Computational methods are essential when problems are too complex for analytical solutions—such as systems with complex geometry, many degrees of freedom, or nonlinear behavior. Simple problems are better handled analytically for speed and insight."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Create a mathematical model of the physical problem",
            "explanation": "Before solving anything computationally, you must first translate the physical problem into a mathematical model (differential equations, constraints, etc.). Only then can you discretize and implement algorithms."

            "correctAnswer": "Converting continuous domains into discrete points or intervals",
            "explanation": "Discretization replaces continuous functions and domains with discrete representations (grids, meshes, time steps) that computers can handle. This is fundamental to all numerical methods."

            "explanation": "The forward difference uses the function value at x and x+h to approximate the derivative. It's first-order accurate O(h), meaning error decreases linearly with step size."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "It has second-order accuracy O(h²) instead of first-order O(h)",
            "explanation": "Central difference (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2h) has O(h²) error, meaning the error decreases quadratically with step size. This makes it more accurate for the same h, but it requires values on both sides of the point."

            "explanation": "Whether it's circuit analysis, structural mechanics, or fluid dynamics, most discretized problems produce large systems of linear equations. Efficient linear solvers are the backbone of computational engineering."

            "correctAnswer": "The numerical solution approaches the exact solution as the discretization is refined",
            "explanation": "A convergent numerical method produces increasingly accurate results as you use finer grids or smaller time steps (h → 0). Convergence is essential for any useful numerical algorithm."

            "explanation": "Order of convergence tells you how fast error decreases with step size. Second-order means error ∝ h². Halving h reduces error by a factor of 4, making second-order methods much more efficient than first-order."
