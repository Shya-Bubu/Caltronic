            "options": [
                "A resistor",
                "A perfect switch with V_D = 0 when conducting",

                "A capacitor"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "A perfect switch with V_D = 0 when conducting",
            "explanation": "The ideal diode is the simplest model: it's a short circuit (V_D = 0) when forward-biased and an open circuit (I = 0) when reverse-biased. No voltage drop, no resistance, no exponential — just on/off."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "4.3 mA",
            "explanation": "I = (Vs − Vγ)/(r + R) = (5 − 0.7)/1000 = 4.3/1000 = 4.3 mA. The constant drop model simply subtracts the 0.7V diode drop from the source voltage."

            "explanation": "The piecewise-linear model represents the diode as Vγ in series with ρ: I = (V_D − Vγ)/ρ for V_D > Vγ. This captures the slope of the I-V curve in forward bias, giving the diode a dynamic resistance."

            "correctAnswer": "The intersection of an exponential and a linear load line is a transcendental equation with no closed-form solution",
            "explanation": "Setting Is(e^(qV/kT)−1) = (−1/(r+R))V_D + Vs/(r+R) creates an equation mixing exponentials and polynomials. This is transcendental — no rearrangement gives V_D = [explicit formula]. Iterative methods like Newton-Raphson are required."

            "explanation": "The operating point Q is where the circuit constraint (load line from KVL) and the device constraint (diode I-V model) are simultaneously satisfied. Graphically, it's the intersection of these two curves."

            "explanation": "The Shockley equation derives from semiconductor physics (Boltzmann statistics). It naturally captures temperature via kT, the exponential I-V relationship that simpler models linearize or ignore, and the reverse saturation current Is."

            "explanation": "From I = (−1/(r+R))V_D + Vs/(r+R): when V_D = 0, I = Vs/(r+R). When I = 0, V_D = Vs. These are the two intercepts of the load line on the V_D-I axes."

            "explanation": "The PDF explicitly states the Shockley equation 'is not used unless explicitly necessary' — for example, in op-amp circuits that exploit the exponential relationship (log amplifiers, multipliers). The constant-drop model is sufficient for standard rectifier analysis."

            "correctAnswer": "Current decreases, V_D increases",
            "explanation": "Increasing R makes the load line steeper (lower slope magnitude = smaller |m| = −1/(r+R)). The y-intercept Vs/(r+R) decreases, pushing the operating point lower on the diode curve: less current, more voltage across the diode."
