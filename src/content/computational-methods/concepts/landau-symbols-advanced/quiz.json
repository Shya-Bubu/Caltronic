            "correctAnswer": "f grows at least as fast as g",
            "explanation": "Ω is the lower bound: f(n) = Ω(g(n)) means ∃ C > 0 such that |f(n)| ≥ C|g(n)| for large n. Big-O is 'at most', Big-Ω is 'at least', Big-Θ is 'exactly'."

            "correctAnswer": "Both O(g(n)) AND Ω(g(n))",
            "explanation": "Θ is the tight bound: f = Θ(g) iff f = O(g) AND f = Ω(g). This means C₁|g| ≤ |f| ≤ C₂|g| — f is sandwiched between two constant multiples of g."

            "correctAnswer": "lim |f/g| = 0",
            "explanation": "Little-o is stricter than Big-O. f = o(g) means f grows strictly slower — the ratio f/g → 0. For example, n = o(n²) because n/n² = 1/n → 0."

            "correctAnswer": "No comparison-based sorting algorithm can use fewer than cn log n comparisons for some c > 0",
            "explanation": "Ω(n log n) is an information-theoretic lower bound: n! possible orderings require log₂(n!) ≈ n log n comparisons to distinguish. No algorithm can beat this — merge sort achieves this bound, so it's optimal."

            "explanation": "Õ(g(n)) means f(n) = O(g(n)·log^ℓ(n)) for some ℓ. It's used when logarithmic factors are practically irrelevant — log(10⁶) ≈ 20, so absorbed into the constant for practical purposes."
