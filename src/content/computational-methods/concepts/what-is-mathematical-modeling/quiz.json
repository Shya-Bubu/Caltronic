            "correctAnswer": "To provide a simplified representation that captures essential behavior",
            "explanation": "Mathematical models are deliberate simplifications that capture what's essential for answering specific questions. Perfect replication would be computationally impossible and unnecessary.",

            "explanation": "Wavelength = c/(f×√εr) = 3×10⁸/(10⁸×2) = 1.5m. Line length (5cm) is much less than λ/10 (15cm), so lumped model is valid.",
