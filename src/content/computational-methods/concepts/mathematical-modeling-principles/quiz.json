            "correctAnswer": "Translating real-world phenomena into equations balancing accuracy and tractability",
            "explanation": "Mathematical modeling is the essential first step before any computation. It involves deciding what physics to include, what assumptions to make, and translating the result into mathematical equations that can be solved computationally."

            "correctAnswer": "The diode is modeled using quantum mechanics",
            "explanation": "Quantum mechanical models are far too detailed for standard circuit analysis. The elementary assumptions listed in the PDF include: zero parasitic L/C/R in wires, low frequency operation, no EMI, reasonable voltage/current range, and fixed resistance values."

            "explanation": "From KVL: Vs = Ir + V_D + IR, giving I = (−1/(r+R))V_D + Vs/(r+R). This is a straight line (y = mx + c) in the V_D-I plane: slope m = −1/(r+R), intercept c = Vs/(r+R)."

            "explanation": "Setting I = 0 in the load line equation: I = (−1/(r+R))V_D + Vs/(r+R) = 0, gives V_D = Vs. This is the open-circuit condition — no current flows, so the diode sees the full source voltage."

            "explanation": "A validation failure means the model doesn't accurately represent reality. No amount of computational power or algorithmic sophistication can fix a wrong model. You must revisit the assumptions, identify which physics was incorrectly omitted or simplified, and refine the model."
