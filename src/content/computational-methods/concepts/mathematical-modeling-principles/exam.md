# Exam Guide: Mathematical Modeling Principles

## Typical Question Patterns

| Pattern | Marks | Time |
|---------|-------|------|
| **Load line derivation** — "Derive the load line for a circuit with Vs, r, R, and a diode." | 5 | 5 min |
| **Assumption listing** — "State 4 assumptions for a simple circuit model and when each fails." | 4-6 | 5 min |
| **Model selection** — "Which diode model would you use for [scenario]? Justify." | 4 | 4 min |
| **Validation** — "Describe how you would validate a circuit model." | 4 | 4 min |

## Common Mistakes

- **Not stating assumptions**: Every model answer should begin with "Assuming..." A model without explicit assumptions is incomplete.
- **Always choosing the most detailed model**: Students often default to the Shockley equation when the ideal diode model is sufficient for the question.
- **Confusing validation with verification**: Validation = "Right model?" (matches reality). Verification = "Model solved right?" (numerically correct).
