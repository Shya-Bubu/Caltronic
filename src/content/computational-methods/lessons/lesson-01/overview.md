# Core Principles of Computational Methods

> **What you're about to learn**: Computational methods are not just a bag of algorithms — they are a structured *way of thinking* about engineering problems. This lesson introduces 26 core principles organized into five families. By the end, you'll have a "mental toolbox" that helps you recognize patterns across different engineering problems and choose the right computational strategy.

## Why This Lesson Matters

Every engineering problem you'll face in your career — whether it's simulating a power grid, optimizing an antenna, or training a neural network — is solved computationally. But the sheer number of available methods can feel overwhelming.

The good news? Almost every computational method is built from a small set of **fundamental principles**. Learn these principles, and you'll be able to:

- **Recognize** which principle applies to a new problem
- **Select** the right strategy without memorizing hundreds of algorithms
- **Evaluate** whether a solution is trustworthy and efficient

## The Five Families

We'll explore these principles in five groups:

| Family | What it covers | Core question |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **Foundations** | How to represent and simplify problems | *How do I make this tractable?* |
| **Algorithmic Strategies** | How to structure a solution procedure | *What kind of steps do I take?* |
| **Modeling & Solution** | How to build and solve mathematical models | *What equation do I write?* |
| **Statistical & Stochastic** | How to handle randomness and uncertainty | *What if I don't have exact values?* |
| **Verification & Efficiency** | How to check correctness and speed up computation | *Can I trust this, and can I afford it?* |

## Prerequisites

This lesson assumes familiarity with:
- Basic calculus (derivatives, integrals)
- Linear algebra (matrices, vectors)
- Basic programming concepts (loops, functions)

No prior knowledge of numerical methods is assumed. We build everything from scratch.
