# Lab 01: Op-Amp Applications

## Welcome to Operational Amplifiers!

This lab explores one of the most versatile and important building blocks in electronics: the **Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp)**. From audio equipment to medical instruments, op-amps are everywhere.

## What You'll Learn

### The 6 Activities

| Activity | Topic | What You'll Build |
|----------|-------|-------------------|
| **1** | Inverting Amplifier | Amplify and invert signals |
| **2** | Non-Inverting Amplifier | Amplify without inversion |
| **3** | Differential Amplifier | Amplify difference between signals, reject noise (CMRR) |
| **4** | Summing Amplifier | Add multiple signals together |
| **5** | Integrator | Perform mathematical integration |
| **6** | Differentiator | Perform mathematical differentiation |
