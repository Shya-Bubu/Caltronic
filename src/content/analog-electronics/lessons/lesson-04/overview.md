This lesson brings the BJT to life as an **amplifier**. In Lesson 03 you learned what a BJT *is* — its structure, its three operating regions, and its v-i characteristics. Now you'll learn how to **set it up** so it can actually amplify signals without distortion.

The journey goes like this:

1. **Why biasing matters** — what happens when you feed a signal into an unbiased BJT (spoiler: half the signal disappears)
2. **Fixed bias** — the simplest biasing scheme, its Q-point calculation, and why it's fragile
3. **Voltage divider bias** — a far more stable design using Thévenin equivalents and emitter feedback
4. **Load lines** — the graphical tool that shows *exactly* where the transistor operates, for both DC and AC
5. **The hybrid-π model** — the small-signal equivalent circuit that lets you analyse amplifier gain without solving nonlinear equations

By the end, you'll be able to design a bias network, predict its Q-point, draw its load lines, and analyse its small-signal behaviour — the complete toolkit for BJT amplifier design.
