# Amplifier Classification & BJT Configurations

You've learned how to bias a BJT and model its small-signal behaviour. Now it's time to use that knowledge to build **real amplifiers** — the circuits that actually make signals bigger.

But "amplifier" is a broad term. A microphone pre-amp boosts voltage. A speaker driver delivers current. A sensor interface converts a tiny current into a measurable voltage. These are fundamentally different jobs, and they demand different circuit architectures.

In this lesson, you will:

- **Classify amplifiers** into four types based on input/output signal: voltage, current, transconductance, and transresistance
- Understand **ideal vs practical parameters** — why R_in, R_out, and gain matter for each type
- Analyse the **Common-Emitter (CE)** configuration — the workhorse of BJT amplifiers
- Compare **Common-Base (CB)** and **Common-Collector (CC)** configurations and their unique strengths
- Model BJT amplifiers as **two-port networks** for systematic analysis

> **This lesson connects theory to practice.** After this, you'll be able to look at any BJT amplifier and predict its behaviour — gain, input impedance, output impedance — using systematic methods.
