# Exam Guide — Diode Models

## How This Topic Appears in Exams

Diode models are heavily tested, often combined with rectifier circuits or simple diode circuit analysis.

## Typical Question Types

| Type | Marks | Time |
|------|-------|------|
| State diode model equations for all three types | 4-6 | 5 min |
| Analyse a half-wave rectifier with specified model | 8-10 | 10 min |
| Sketch output waveform for given input and model | 5-8 | 7 min |
| Compare results using different models | 4-6 | 5 min |

## Mark-Scoring Tips

1. **Always state which model you're using** before starting calculations. This frames your entire solution.
2. For rectifier problems, clearly show: (a) the condition for diode ON, (b) the output expression when ON, (c) the output when OFF.
3. **Draw the output waveform** even if not asked — it demonstrates understanding.

## Common Mistakes

- Using V_γ = 0.7V when the question specifies the ideal switch model (V_γ = 0)
- Forgetting that the diode only conducts when V_S > V_γ (not at V_S = 0)
- Omitting R_f in Model 3 calculations (the current divider between R_f and R_L)
- Confusing V_T (thermal voltage, 25mV) with V_γ (forward drop, 0.7V)
