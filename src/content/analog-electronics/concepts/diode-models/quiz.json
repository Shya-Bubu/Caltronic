            "options": [
                "0.7V",
                "0.3V",
                "0V",
                "Depends on current"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "0V",
            "explanation": "The ideal switch model treats the diode as a perfect short circuit when forward-biased: V_D = 0, regardless of current. This is the simplest model and ignores the real 0.6-0.7V forward drop. It's only useful when the signal voltage is much larger than 0.7V."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "9.3V",
            "explanation": "In the CVD model, the diode drops a constant V_γ = 0.7V when conducting. Peak output = V_peak − V_γ = 10 − 0.7 = 9.3V. The 0.7V is 'lost' across the diode, reducing the output."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "V_D = V_γ + I_D × R_f",
            "explanation": "The PWL model includes both the threshold voltage V_γ and the forward resistance R_f. The total forward voltage drop increases linearly with current: V_D = V_γ + I_D × R_f. When R_f = 0, this reduces to the CVD model."

                "Ideal switch"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Ideal switch",
            "explanation": "At 230V, the 0.7V diode drop is less than 0.3% of the signal — negligible. The ideal switch model gives sufficiently accurate results with minimal calculation. The CVD model would work too but adds unnecessary complexity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "1.2V",
            "explanation": "V_D = V_γ + I_D × R_f = 0.7 + 0.05 × 10 = 0.7 + 0.5 = 1.2V. The R_f term contributes 0.5V at this current level, increasing the total drop significantly above the threshold voltage."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "It creates transcendental equations (V inside and outside exponential)",
            "explanation": "When you write KVL: V_S = I_S×e^(V_D/V_T)×R + V_D, the variable V_D appears both inside an exponential and outside it. This transcendental equation has no closed-form solution — you need numerical methods (Newton-Raphson) or graphical techniques."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "V_S > V_γ",
            "explanation": "With the CVD model, the diode needs the source voltage to exceed V_γ (≈ 0.7V) before it conducts. Between 0V and 0.7V, the diode remains OFF and the output is 0V. This creates a small 'dead zone' at the base of the sine wave."

            "explanation": "In the forward region: I_D = (V_D − V_γ)/R_f. This is a line starting at V_D = V_γ with slope ΔI/ΔV = 1/R_f. Smaller R_f → steeper slope → closer to the CVD model (which has infinite slope = zero resistance at V_γ)."

            "correctAnswer": "0.6-0.7V",
            "explanation": "V_γ ≈ 0.6-0.7V for silicon. This is the voltage where the Ebers-Moll exponential produces readily measurable current (milliamps). Germanium diodes use V_γ ≈ 0.3V. Don't confuse V_γ with V_T (thermal voltage ≈ 25mV)."

            "correctAnswer": "A voltage source V_γ with zero series resistance",
            "explanation": "When ON, the CVD model maintains V_D = V_γ regardless of current — exactly like an ideal voltage source. The forward resistance is zero (slope is infinite on the V-I plot). The PWL model adds a series R_f to this voltage source."
