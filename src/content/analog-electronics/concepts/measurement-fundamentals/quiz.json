            "options": [
                "Error is always 0.5%",
                "Error is 0.5% of full scale plus 2 digit counts",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Error is 0.5% of reading plus 2 digit counts in the last digit",
            "explanation": "The '% of reading' component scales with the measured value. The 'digits' component is fixed uncertainty in the least significant digit. Both combine to give total uncertainty.",

            "correctAnswer": "Systematic error",
            "explanation": "Systematic errors produce consistent bias (always too high or too low). Random errors scatter around the true value without consistent direction. Parallax is a type of systematic error in analog meters.",

            "explanation": "Standard error = s/√n. Going from n=5 to n=25 means √n increases from √5 to √25 = 5. Ratio = 5/√5 = √5 ≈ 2.2. More measurements help, but with diminishing returns.",

            "correctAnswer": "External voltage interferes with the DMM's internal measurement voltage",
            "explanation": "The DMM measures R by applying a small known current and measuring voltage. External circuit voltage overwhelms this measurement, giving false readings. The DMM may also be damaged by unexpected voltage.",

            "explanation": "A 10× probe divides the signal by 10 before showing it. If the scope doesn't know this, it displays the divided value without compensation. A 10V signal shows as 1V — 10× too low.",

            "explanation": "δV = 0.05/5.00 = 1.0%. δI = 0.05/2.50 = 2.0%. Current has twice the relative uncertainty and will dominate when calculating R = V/I uncertainty.",

            "correctAnswer": "δz = 3δx",
            "explanation": "For z = xⁿ, the rule is δz = |n|·δx. With n = 3, we get δz = 3·δx. The exponent multiplies the relative uncertainty — powers amplify uncertainty significantly.",

            "correctAnswer": "The meter draws current from the circuit, reducing the measured voltage",
            "explanation": "An ideal voltmeter has infinite resistance and draws zero current. Real voltmeters (especially analog ones) draw small current, creating voltage drop elsewhere in circuit and reducing measured voltage. High-impedance DMMs (10MΩ+) minimize this.",
