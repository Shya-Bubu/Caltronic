## Exam Strategy: DC & AC Load Lines

### What Examiners Ask

Load lines appear as a **combined analytical + graphical problem** (12-20 marks). You'll usually calculate the load line parameters and then sketch them.

### Typical Question Patterns

1. **"Draw the DC load line and find the Q-point"** (8-12 marks)
   - Calculate the two intercepts (2-3 marks)
   - Draw the line on the output characteristics (2-3 marks)
   - Find Q-point at intersection with I_BQ curve (2-3 marks)
   - State Q = (V_CEQ, I_CQ) (1 mark)

2. **"Draw the AC equivalent circuit and AC load line"** (8-10 marks)
   - Show the AC equivalent circuit with rules applied (3-4 marks)
   - Calculate AC slope and draw through Q-point (3-4 marks)
   - Determine maximum signal swing (2-3 marks)

3. **"Is the circuit properly biased for a signal of amplitude X?"** (4-6 marks)
   - Check if signal swing hits saturation or cutoff along the AC load line

### Mark Allocation Tips

- **Sketch ≠ art**: a clean, labelled sketch with correct intercepts, Q-point, and slope indication earns full marks
- **Label everything**: axes, intercepts, Q-point coordinates, slope values
- **Show AC equivalent circuit explicitly** — don't just state the AC slope
- **State what the slope represents**: "Slope = −1/(R_C+R_E) where R_C = ... and R_E = ..."

### Time Guide

- DC load line + Q-point: 8-10 minutes
- AC equivalent + AC load line: 8-10 minutes
- Signal swing check: 3-4 minutes

### Common Mistakes That Lose Marks

- Drawing the AC load line with the wrong slope (using R_C + R_E instead of R_C + r_e1)
- Not drawing the AC load line through the Q-point
- Confusing which line the signal travels along (it's the AC load line, not the DC)
- Forgetting to account for the bypass capacitor when deriving the AC resistance
