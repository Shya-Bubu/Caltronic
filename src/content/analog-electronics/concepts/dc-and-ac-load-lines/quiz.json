            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "From KVL: V_CC = I_C(R_C + R_E) + V_CE. Rearranging: I_C = −V_CE/(R_C+R_E) + V_CC/(R_C+R_E). The slope is −1/(R_C+R_E), which is negative because increasing V_CE decreases I_C along the line."

                "V_CE = V_CC (at I_C=0) and I_C = V_CC/R_C (at V_CE=0)",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "At I_C = 0: V_CE = V_CC (all supply voltage appears across the transistor). At V_CE = 0: I_C = V_CC/(R_C+R_E) (maximum possible current through the resistors). Connect these two points with a straight line."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Q-point satisfies both constraints simultaneously: the circuit constraint (DC load line) and the transistor's physics (I_BQ characteristic curve). Their intersection gives (V_CEQ, I_CQ)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "At signal frequencies: capacitors → short (X_C ≈ 0), DC voltage sources → short to ground (they have no AC content), DC current sources → open (no AC content). This leaves only the AC signal path and the AC impedances."

            "type": "multiple-choice",
            "options": [
                "Because V_CC is larger for AC signals",
                "Because the bypass capacitor shorts part of R_E, so the AC sees a smaller total resistance (R_C + r_e1 < R_C + R_E)",

                "Because the coupling capacitor adds impedance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The DC load line has slope −1/(R_C+R_E) including all of R_E. The bypass capacitor across R_E2 shorts it at AC frequencies, so the AC load line has slope −1/(R_C+r_e1) where r_e1 < R_E. Smaller denominator → steeper slope."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The signal creates small variations around the Q-point. At signal frequencies, the effective resistance is the AC resistance (with bypass caps shorted), so the operating point traces the AC load line, not the DC load line."

                "The supply voltage V_CC only",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The signal swings along the AC load line from the Q-point towards saturation (V_CE ≈ 0.2 V) in one direction and cutoff (I_C = 0) in the other. The maximum symmetric swing is limited by whichever boundary is closer. If clipping occurs in one direction first, the output is asymmetrically distorted."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "I_C-intercept = V_CC/(R_C + R_E) = 12/(4k + 2k) = 12/6k = 2 mA. This is the maximum possible DC collector current in this circuit (when V_CE = 0)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "V_CE can decrease from V_CEQ = 8 V down to V_CE(sat) ≈ 0.2 V before the transistor saturates. That's a swing of 8 − 0.2 = 7.8 V towards saturation. Towards cutoff, V_CE can increase to V_CC = 12 V, a swing of 12 − 8 = 4 V. The maximum symmetric swing is the smaller: 4 V."

                "The line shifts to the right with the same slope",
                "The V_CE-intercept stays at V_CC, the I_C-intercept decreases, and the slope becomes less steep",
                "Both intercepts double",
                "The load line doesn't change because it depends only on V_CC"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "V_CE-intercept = V_CC (unchanged — doesn't depend on R_C). I_C-intercept = V_CC/(R_C+R_E) decreases because the denominator increases. Slope = −1/(R_C+R_E) becomes less steep (smaller magnitude). The line effectively pivots around the V_CC point on the V_CE axis."
