            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Av = 1 + R2/R1",
            "explanation": "The non-inverting amplifier gain is Av = 1 + R2/R1. The '+1' term is crucial and distinguishes it from the inverting amplifier formula.",

            "correctAnswer": "Non-inverting (+)",

            "correctAnswer": "1",
            "explanation": "Av = 1 + R2/R1. Since R2/R1 ≥ 0, the minimum gain is 1 (when R2 = 0). This is the unity-gain buffer configuration.",

            "explanation": "The input connects directly to the op-amp's high-impedance non-inverting input. No current flows in, making Zin extremely high (megaohms).",

            "correctAnswer": "Very high input impedance doesn't load the source",
            "explanation": "High-impedance sources can't deliver much current. The non-inverting amp's very high Zin means it draws almost no current, preserving the source signal.",
