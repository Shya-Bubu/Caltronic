            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Operational amplifier",
            "explanation": "Op-amp is short for operational amplifier, named because it can perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, integration, and differentiation on signals.",

            "id": "q2",

            "options": [
                "Pin 2",
                "Pin 3",
                "Pin 6",
                "Pin 7"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Pin 6",
            "explanation": "Pin 6 is the output of the 741 op-amp. Pin 2 is inverting input, Pin 3 is non-inverting input, Pin 7 is V+, and Pin 4 is V-.",
            "difficulty": "easy"

        {
            "id": "q3",
            "prompt": "What is the 'virtual short' rule in op-amp analysis?",
            "options": [
                "Output equals input",
                "V+ = V- when negative feedback is present",
                "The op-amp inputs are physically shorted",
                "Current flows between inputs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "V+ = V- when negative feedback is present",
            "explanation": "The virtual short rule states that with negative feedback, the voltage at the inverting and non-inverting terminals are equal. They are NOT physically connected - hence 'virtual'.",
            "difficulty": "medium"
        },
        {
            "id": "q4",
            "prompt": "Why does essentially no current flow into op-amp input terminals?",
            "options": [
                "They are grounded",
                "Very high input impedance",
                "They are connected together",
                "The chip is damaged"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Very high input impedance",
            "explanation": "Op-amps have very high input impedance (megaohms). According to Ohm's law, high impedance means extremely small current. We approximate this as zero for analysis.",
            "difficulty": "medium"
        },
        {
            "id": "q5",
            "prompt": "What happens to an op-amp without negative feedback when a small positive voltage is at V+ and V- is grounded?",
            "options": [
                "Output is zero",
                "Output saturates to positive supply",
                "Output oscillates",
                "Chip is damaged"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Output saturates to positive supply",
            "explanation": "Without feedback, the open-loop gain (200,000) amplifies even tiny differences. A positive V+ causes Vo = 200,000 × (V+ - 0), which immediately hits the positive saturation limit (~+14V).",
            "difficulty": "medium"

            "options": [
                "15V",
                "14V",
                "12V",
                "10V"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "14V",
            "explanation": "The output cannot reach the supply rails exactly. Due to internal transistor drops, the maximum output is about 1-2V less than the supply, so approximately ±13V to ±14V.",
            "difficulty": "medium"
        },
        {
            "id": "q7",

                "100,000 or more"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "100,000 or more",
            "explanation": "Typical op-amps have open-loop gains of 100,000 to 1,000,000 (100dB to 120dB). This enormous gain is what makes the virtual short approximation valid.",
            "difficulty": "medium"

            "id": "q8",
            "prompt": "What is the purpose of negative feedback in op-amp circuits?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the gain",
                "Control the gain and prevent saturation",
                "Invert the output",
                "Increase input impedance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Control the gain and prevent saturation",
            "explanation": "Negative feedback 'tames' the op-amp's enormous open-loop gain into a controlled, predictable closed-loop gain. Without it, the op-amp saturates at the supply rails.",
            "difficulty": "hard"
        },

            "id": "q9",
            "prompt": "Which power supply pins must be connected on a 741 op-amp?",
            "options": [
                "Only Pin 7 (V+)",
                "Only Pin 4 (V-)",

                "Pins 1 and 5"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Both Pin 7 (V+) and Pin 4 (V-)",
            "explanation": "The 741 requires dual supply: +15V to Pin 7 and -15V to Pin 4. Forgetting either supply is a common mistake that results in no output or incorrect operation.",
            "difficulty": "easy"
        },
        {
            "id": "q10",
            "prompt": "The gain-bandwidth product of a 741 is 1MHz. If the circuit gain is set to 100, what is the approximate bandwidth?",
            "options": [
                "1 MHz",
                "100 kHz",
                "10 kHz",
                "1 kHz"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "10 kHz",
            "explanation": "Gain × Bandwidth = GBP. So Bandwidth = GBP/Gain = 1,000,000/100 = 10,000 Hz = 10 kHz. Higher gain means lower bandwidth - there's always a tradeoff!",
