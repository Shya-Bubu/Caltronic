            "prompt": "Why is R5 chosen to be much smaller than RL?",
            "options": [
                "To maximise voltage gain",
                "So that connecting RL doesn't significantly change the DC operating point (stiff output)",
                "To reduce power consumption",
                "Because E12 only has small values"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "So that connecting RL doesn't significantly change the DC operating point (stiff output)",
            "explanation": "When R5 << RL, the current through R5 is much larger than the load current. Connecting RL draws only a small additional current, so the Q-point barely changes. This is the 'stiff output' design principle."

            "explanation": "KVL around the collector-emitter loop: VCC - ICQ×R4 - VCEQ - ICQ×R5 = 0, which gives VCC = ICQ(R4+R5) + VCEQ. This is used to find R4 once R5, VCEQ, and ICQ are known."

            "explanation": "The AC signal sees R5∥RL (180Ω) not R4+R5 (370Ω). The steeper AC load line means for the same ICQ, the voltage swing is more limited. You must verify the swing on the AC load line to ensure no clipping."
