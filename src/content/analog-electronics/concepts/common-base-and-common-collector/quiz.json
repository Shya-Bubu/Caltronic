            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Emitter",
            "explanation": "CB: input at emitter, output at collector, base is common (AC grounded)."

            "correctAnswer": "1",
            "explanation": "CC is a voltage follower: A_V ≈ 1. It provides current gain (β+1) but not voltage gain."

            "explanation": "In CE, C_BC is multiplied by (1+|A_V|) due to Miller effect. In CB, C_BC is between output and ground — no multiplication."

            "correctAnswer": "α ≈ 1",
            "explanation": "CB current gain is α = β/(β+1) ≈ 0.99. Almost unity — CB amplifies voltage, not current."

            "explanation": "CC has R_in ≈ β·R_E (very high) and R_out ≈ r_e (very low). This transforms high-impedance sources to low-impedance outputs."
