# Exam Preparation: CB and CC Configurations
## How This Is Tested
- Compare all three configurations in a table (5-8 marks)
- Calculate R_in, R_out, A_V for CB or CC (8-10 marks)
- Explain why CB has better high-frequency response (3-5 marks)
- Design a two-stage amplifier using CE + CC (10 marks)
## Common Mistakes
1. Confusing which terminal is "common" in each configuration
2. Getting CB and CC R_in/R_out mixed up
3. Forgetting that CB current gain is α ≈ 1, not β
4. Not considering Miller effect advantage of CB
