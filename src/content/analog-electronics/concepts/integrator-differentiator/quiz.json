            "correctAnswer": "In the feedback path",
            "explanation": "In an integrator, the capacitor is in the FEEDBACK path (from output to inverting input). In a differentiator, it's the opposite - capacitor is at the input.",

            "correctAnswer": "Triangle wave",
            "explanation": "Integrating a constant gives a ramp. A square wave alternates between +V and -V (constants), so the output alternates between up-ramps and down-ramps, creating a triangle wave.",
