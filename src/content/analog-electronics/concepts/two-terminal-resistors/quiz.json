            ],
            "correctAnswer": "1kΩ ± 5%",
            "explanation": "Brown=1, Black=0, Red=×100, Gold=5% tolerance. So 10 × 100 = 1000Ω = 1kΩ ± 5%. Option A would be Brown-Black-Brown-Gold. Option C would be Brown-Black-Orange-Gold.",

                "R = AL/ρ"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "R = ρL/A",
            "explanation": "R = ρL/A where ρ is resistivity, L is length, and A is cross-sectional area. Resistance increases with length (more material to traverse) and decreases with area (more paths for current).",

            "correctAnswer": "Decrease by 25Ω",
            "explanation": "ΔR = R₀ × α × ΔT = 1000 × (-500×10⁻⁶) × 50 = -25Ω. The negative coefficient means resistance decreases with temperature. This is characteristic of carbon materials.",

            "correctAnswer": "Metal film (±0.1%)",
            "explanation": "Instrumentation amplifiers require precise resistor ratios for accurate gain. Metal film resistors with ±0.1% tolerance minimize gain errors. Carbon types would introduce unacceptable variability in critical applications.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "No, it exceeds 50% derating guideline",
            "explanation": "Standard engineering practice is to derate by 50% for reliability. A 0.25W resistor should only dissipate 0.125W continuously. Using it at 0.2W (80% of rating) risks overheating and premature failure. Use a 0.5W resistor instead.",

            "correctAnswer": "Both B and C are possible",
            "explanation": "In the 4-band code, gold can appear as Band 3 (multiplier = ×0.1) or Band 4 (tolerance = ±5%). Context determines meaning. Gold in position 4 (closest to one end) is tolerance; gold in position 3 is the 0.1× multiplier.",

            "explanation": "A = π(d/2)² = π(0.5×10⁻³)² = 7.85×10⁻⁷ m². R = ρL/A = (1.7×10⁻⁸)(10)/(7.85×10⁻⁷) = 0.22Ω. This is why power cables use thick conductors over long distances.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "The coiled wire acts as an inductor",
            "explanation": "Wirewound resistors physically wind resistance wire around a core, creating turns that form an inductor. Film resistors have no coil structure. This parasitic inductance makes wirewound resistors unsuitable for high-frequency applications above ~50kHz.",

            "explanation": "For ±5%: Max = 105Ω, Min = 95Ω. Ratio = 105/95 = 1.105. For ±1%: Max = 101Ω, Min = 99Ω. Ratio = 101/99 = 1.020. This shows why precision resistors are essential when resistor ratios matter (e.g., amplifier gain).",
