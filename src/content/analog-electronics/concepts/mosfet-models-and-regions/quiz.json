            "prompt": "The MOSFET is controlled by:",
            "options": [
                "Base current",
                "Gate-source voltage",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Gate-source voltage",
            "explanation": "The MOSFET is a voltage-controlled device. The gate-source voltage V_GS determines whether the channel forms and how much drain current flows. Unlike the BJT, the gate draws essentially zero DC current because it's insulated by the gate oxide."

            "id": "q2",

                "K(V_GS − V_T)",
                "(K/2)(V_GS − V_T)²",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "(K/2)(V_GS − V_T)²",
            "explanation": "The saturation region equation is I_DS = (K/2)(V_GS − V_T)². Note the (K/2) factor and the squared term. The current depends only on V_GS (not V_DS) — the MOSFET acts as a voltage-controlled current source."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "V_DS < V_GS − V_T (and V_GS > V_T)",
            "explanation": "Triode (linear) region: the MOSFET is ON (V_GS > V_T) and V_DS is small enough that the channel hasn't pinched off. The condition is V_DS < V_GS − V_T = V_OV. In this region, the MOSFET behaves like a voltage-controlled resistor."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "BJT active mode",
            "explanation": "MOSFET saturation = amplification mode (I_DS constant, current source behaviour). This is equivalent to BJT ACTIVE mode. Confusingly, 'BJT saturation' means both junctions forward biased (switch ON) — the opposite role. This naming inconsistency is a common source of confusion."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "V_GS − V_T",
            "explanation": "V_OV = V_GS − V_T is the overdrive voltage — the amount by which V_GS exceeds the threshold. It determines both the drain current in saturation (I_DS = K/2 × V_OV²) and the boundary between triode and saturation (V_DS = V_OV)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "4 mA",
            "explanation": "I_DS = (K/2)(V_GS − V_T)² = (2/2)(3 − 1)² = 1 × 4 = 4 mA. V_OV = 3 − 1 = 2V, so saturation requires V_DS ≥ 2V. If V_DS < 2V, the MOSFET would be in triode and this formula doesn't apply."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "K(V_GS − V_T)",
            "explanation": "g_m = dI_DS/dV_GS = K(V_GS − V_T) = KV_OV. This is the small-signal parameter that connects to the VCCS model: i_d = g_m × v_gs. Larger K or larger overdrive voltage means higher transconductance and higher gain."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "A short circuit (R = 0)",
            "explanation": "The simplest MOSFET model treats it as a perfect switch: OFF = open circuit, ON = short circuit. This ignores the channel resistance and the distinction between triode and saturation. It's useful only for crude digital logic estimates."

            "correctAnswer": "−g_m × R_D",
            "explanation": "A_v = −g_m R_D. The negative sign indicates signal inversion (increasing V_GS → increasing I_DS → increasing voltage drop across R_D → decreasing V_out). g_m converts input voltage to current, R_D converts current to output voltage."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Keep V_DS ≥ V_GS − V_T for the entire signal swing",
            "explanation": "For linear amplification, the MOSFET must stay in saturation at all times: V_DS ≥ V_OV for every value of the input signal. If the output swings too far, V_DS drops below V_OV and the MOSFET enters triode — the amplification relationship breaks and the output clips."
