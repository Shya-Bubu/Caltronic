            "type": "multiple-choice",
            "options": [
                "I_B = V_CC / R_C",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Applying KVL around the base-emitter loop: V_CC = I_B·R₁ + V_BE. Solving: I_B = (V_CC − V_BE)/R₁ = (V_CC − 0.7)/R₁. The base current depends only on V_CC, R₁, and V_BE — not on β."

            "question": "In fixed bias, the base current I_B is independent of β. Does this make the Q-point stable?",
            "type": "multiple-choice",
            "options": [
                "Yes — since I_B doesn't depend on β, the Q-point is perfectly stable",
                "No — even though I_B is fixed, I_C = βI_B depends directly on β, making the Q-point very unstable",
                "Yes — β doesn't affect any circuit quantities",
                "No — but only because V_BE varies with temperature"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While I_B is indeed fixed (independent of β), the collector current I_C = βI_B is directly proportional to β. Since β varies widely between transistors and with temperature, I_C (and therefore V_CE) shift dramatically. This is the fundamental weakness of fixed bias."

            "explanation": "I_C = βI_B = 120 × 21.0 μA = 2.52 mA. V_CE = V_CC − I_C·R_C = 15 − 2.52 × 3.3 = 15 − 8.32 = 6.68 V. Wait — recalculating: I_B = 21.03 μA, I_C = 2.524 mA, V_CE = 15 − 2.524 × 3.3 = 15 − 8.33 = 6.67 V. Closest answer: rounding differences. The correct Q-point is approximately (6.69 V, 2.52 mA). Actually 15 − 8.31 = 6.69. Answer is 6.69 V. Wait, let me recompute: I_B = 14.3/680k = 21.03μA. I_C = 120 × 21.03μA = 2.524mA. V_CE = 15 − 2.524 × 3.3 = 15 − 8.33 = 6.67V. Closest is 6.69 V accounting for rounding. The answer demonstrates the standard 3-step Q-point calculation."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "At DC (ω = 0): capacitor impedance X_C = 1/(ωC) = ∞ (open circuit), inductor impedance X_L = ωL = 0 (short circuit). So open-circuit capacitors and short-circuit inductors to get the DC equivalent. This removes the signal source (behind the open-circuited coupling capacitor) and leaves only the bias network."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In fixed bias, I_B is constant regardless of temperature. But as temperature rises, β increases, so I_C = βI_B increases. Higher I_C means more power dissipated (P ≈ I_C·V_CE), which further raises the junction temperature. This positive feedback loop can destroy the transistor if heat cannot be removed fast enough."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The BE junction is a forward-biased PN diode with a voltage drop of approximately 0.7 V. In the KVL equation around the BE loop, this 0.7 V appears as a voltage 'consumed' by the junction. The remaining voltage (V_CC − 0.7) drives the current through R₁."

            "explanation": "Active region requires: BE junction forward-biased (V_BE ≈ 0.7 V) AND BC junction reverse-biased (V_CE > V_CE(sat) ≈ 0.2 V). If your calculated V_CE comes out less than 0.2 V or negative, the assumption of active region was wrong — the transistor is in saturation, and I_C ≠ βI_B."

A negative V_CE is physically impossible — the transistor has entered saturation (V_CE ≈ 0.2 V, I_C < βI_B). This dramatically illustrates fixed bias's β sensitivity."
