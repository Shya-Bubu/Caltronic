            "prompt": "What does 'direct coupling' mean in a multi-stage amplifier?",
            "options": [
                "The stages are connected using a transformer",
                "The collector of one stage is connected directly to the base of the next without a coupling capacitor",
                "Both transistors share the same base terminal",
                "The stages are connected using an operational amplifier"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "The collector of one stage is connected directly to the base of the next without a coupling capacitor",
            "explanation": "Direct coupling means no capacitor between stages — the DC collector voltage of Stage 1 serves directly as the base bias voltage of Stage 2. This eliminates low-frequency rolloff caused by coupling capacitors."

            "id": "q2",
            "prompt": "Which transistor combination is used in this lab's two-stage amplifier?",
            "options": [
                "Two NPN transistors (BC549 + BC549)",
                "Two PNP transistors (BC556 + BC556)",
                "NPN first stage (BC549) + PNP second stage (BC556)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "NPN first stage (BC549) + PNP second stage (BC556)",
            "explanation": "The first stage uses an NPN BC549 and the second stage uses a PNP BC556. This complementary arrangement provides thermal stability because the temperature drifts of the two transistor types partially cancel each other."

            "id": "q3",
            "prompt": "What is the primary frequency response advantage of direct coupling over capacitor coupling?",
            "options": [
                "Higher gain at high frequencies",
                "Gain is maintained down to DC (no low-frequency cutoff)",
                "Better noise performance above 1 MHz",
                "Wider bandwidth at radio frequencies"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Gain is maintained down to DC (no low-frequency cutoff)",
            "explanation": "A coupling capacitor acts as a high-pass filter — at low frequencies, its impedance (1/ωC) becomes large and reduces gain. Direct coupling eliminates this effect, maintaining gain all the way down to DC."

            "id": "q4",

            "options": [
                "PNP transistors are immune to temperature changes",
                "The temperature drifts of NPN and PNP partially cancel each other",
                "NPN-PNP uses less power, generating less heat",
                "PNP transistors have higher thermal resistance cases"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "The temperature drifts of NPN and PNP partially cancel each other",
            "explanation": "When temperature rises, IC1 increases and VC1 decreases. Since VC1 = VB2 (direct coupling), this lower VB2 causes IC2 in the PNP to decrease. The opposing directions create inherent negative feedback that partially cancels the drift."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "VC1 (collector voltage of Q1)",
            "explanation": "This is the key relationship in direct coupling. The collector of Q1 connects directly to the base of Q2, so VC1 = VB2. Any change in IC1 (through R1) changes VC1, which directly changes the bias of Q2."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "150Ω",
            "explanation": "150Ω is the nearest E12 value to 140Ω (E12 values: ...120, 150, 180...). Custom values are not available in standard resistor kits. 120Ω would also work but introduces more error. The designer chooses based on which direction of error is more acceptable."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "56 kΩ",
            "explanation": "hoe is the output admittance in siemens. The output resistance is 1/hoe = 1/(18 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 55,600Ω ≈ 56 kΩ. Since this is much larger than typical collector/emitter resistors (1-5 kΩ), we can often ignore hoe in our analysis."

            "options": [
                "Two — one for each stage",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "One — the Ra/Rb divider biases both stages",
            "explanation": "This is the elegance of direct coupling: a single voltage divider (Ra, Rb) at the input sets VB1, which determines IC1, which determines VC1 = VB2, which determines IC2. One bias network controls everything."

            "correctAnswer": "The 10× rule of thumb",
            "explanation": "When two resistors are in parallel and one is 10× larger, the parallel combination is within 10% of the smaller resistor. Engineers accept this error to simplify analysis. For example, if R1 = 10kΩ and R2 = 100kΩ, then R1 ∥ R2 ≈ 9.1kΩ ≈ R1."

            "explanation": "From the datasheet, the maximum power dissipation at Ta = 25°C is 500 mW. This is calculated as P = VCE × IC, and the designer must ensure the operating point stays below this limit at all times."
