            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The hybrid-π model is a linearised small-signal equivalent circuit obtained from the general h-parameter model by setting h_re ≈ 0 and h_oe ≈ 0 (or R_out → ∞). It replaces the nonlinear BJT with r_π and a dependent current source for AC analysis around the Q-point."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "g_m = I_CQ/V_T relates the small-signal collector current to the base-emitter voltage: i_c = g_m·v_be. At room temperature with V_T = 26 mV, a 1 mA bias gives g_m = 38.5 mA/V. Crucially, g_m does not depend on β."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "r_π = h_ie is the small-signal resistance between base and emitter. It equals β/g_m = βV_T/I_CQ. Unlike g_m, r_π does depend on β. Higher β or lower I_CQ gives a larger r_π (higher input impedance)."

            "explanation": "r_e = 1/g_m = V_T/I_CQ ≈ 26mV/I_CQ (mA). It's the intrinsic small-signal emitter resistance. It relates to r_π by r_π = β·r_e — the base 'sees' the emitter resistance multiplied by β because the base current is β times smaller."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "g_m = β/r_π. Since r_π = βV_T/I_CQ, substituting: g_m = β/(βV_T/I_CQ) = I_CQ/V_T. The β in the numerator and denominator cancel exactly. This is why g_m depends only on the Q-point current and the thermal voltage."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "R_out appears in parallel with the load at the output. When R_out >> R_L (typically R_out > 10 R_L), most of the current flows through R_L and R_out has negligible effect. Since R_out is typically 100k–1MΩ and R_L is typically 1k–10kΩ, this condition is almost always met."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The hybrid-π model is valid only for small-signal AC analysis around the DC operating point (Q-point). You must first find the Q-point using DC analysis (with the nonlinear model), then use the hybrid-π model to analyse how small AC signals are amplified."
