            "prompt": "For a 7Vpp output swing, the peak voltage Vp is:",
            "options": [
                "7V",
                "3.5V",
                "14V",
                "1.75V"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "3.5V",
            "explanation": "Vp = Vpp/2 = 7/2 = 3.5V. This is the maximum voltage the output swings from the Q-point in either direction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2",
            "prompt": "The safe range for VCEQ (after all margins) is:",
            "options": [
                "0V to 15V",
                "3.5V to 11.5V",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "4.5V to 7.5V",
            "explanation": "Lower bound: Vp + 1V margin = 4.5V. Upper bound before AC: VCC - Vp - 1V = 10.5V. After 3V AC margin: 10.5 - 3 = 7.5V. Full safe range: 4.5V to 7.5V."

        {
            "id": "q3",
            "prompt": "Why is the AC load line steeper than the DC load line?",
            "options": [
                "Because the capacitors add extra resistance at AC frequencies",
                "Because R5∥RL < R4+R5, making the AC load resistance smaller",
                "Because the transistor gain increases at higher frequencies",
                "Because VCC is reduced by AC signals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Because R5∥RL < R4+R5, making the AC load resistance smaller",
            "explanation": "The DC load line has slope -1/(R4+R5) while the AC load line has slope -1/(R5∥RL). Since R5∥RL is smaller (the parallel combination and the coupling capacitor shorts R4), the AC slope magnitude is larger — meaning a steeper line."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "The peak AC current: Vp/(R5∥RL)",
            "explanation": "ICQ must be at least Vp/(R5∥RL) so that during the negative half-cycle, the collector current doesn't go to zero (cutoff). With Vp=3.5V and R5∥RL=180Ω, the minimum is 19.4mA."
        },

            "id": "q5",

            "options": [
                "It is the only valid value",
                "It is the midpoint of the safe range (4.5V to 7.5V)",
                "Because VCC/2 = 7.5V is too high",
                "Because 6V maximises the transistor power"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "It is the midpoint of the safe range (4.5V to 7.5V)",
            "explanation": "The midpoint of 4.5V-7.5V is 6V. This gives equal margin for clipping on both sides. However, any value in the range is valid — it is a design choice, not a fixed answer."

            "id": "q6",
            "prompt": "What happens if the Q-point is set at VCEQ = 12V with a 7Vpp swing requirement?",
            "options": [
                "The output clips symmetrically",
                "Cutoff clipping occurs — the output cannot swing above 12+3.5=15.5V because VCC=15V",
                "Saturation clipping occurs",
                "The gain doubles"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Cutoff clipping occurs — the output cannot swing above 12+3.5=15.5V because VCC=15V",
            "explanation": "With VCEQ=12V, the positive swing would need to reach 15.5V, but VCC limits the output to about 14V. The top of the sine wave gets clipped flat. This is cutoff clipping."

        {
            "id": "q7",
            "prompt": "Why do we add a 1V margin for VCEsat instead of using VCEsat directly?",
            "options": [
                "VCEsat is always exactly 1V",
                "To account for manufacturing tolerances and ensure the transistor stays in the active region even with component variation",
                "Because the formula requires an integer",
                "Because 0.2V is too precise to measure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "To account for manufacturing tolerances and ensure the transistor stays in the active region even with component variation",
            "explanation": "VCEsat ≈ 0.2V but real transistors vary. Adding a 1V margin ensures that even with 5% resistor tolerances and transistor variation, the Q-point stays safely above saturation."

        {
            "id": "q8",
            "prompt": "The ICQ1 for Stage 1 is set to 2.5mA. How is this value determined?",
            "options": [
                "From the gain equation directly",
                "By choosing ICQ2/ICQ1 ≈ 10 (design choice: second stage current is 10× first stage)",

                "It is fixed by the bias resistors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "By choosing ICQ2/ICQ1 ≈ 10 (design choice: second stage current is 10× first stage)",
            "explanation": "The professor chooses ICQ1 = ICQ2/10 = 25/10 = 2.5mA. This ensures that the first stage's collector current is large enough relative to the second stage's base current to ignore the loading effect. The ratio 10-20× is a design choice."

        {
            "id": "q9",
            "prompt": "Why does the professor start the design from the output stage rather than the input?",
            "options": [
                "Because the output stage is simpler",
                "Because the output specifications (Vpp, RL) provide the tightest constraints, making them the logical starting point",
                "Because the input doesn't have any specifications",
                "Because the input stage has no resistors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Because the output specifications (Vpp, RL) provide the tightest constraints, making them the logical starting point",
            "explanation": "The output specs (7Vpp across 1kΩ load with VCC=15V) directly constrain VCEQ and ICQ. Starting from these constraints and working backwards ensures you don't guess the Q-point. The input has more freedom."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "180.3Ω",
            "explanation": "R5∥RL = (220 × 1000) / (220 + 1000) = 220000/1220 = 180.3Ω. This is the AC load resistance that determines the AC load line slope and the minimum ICQ."
