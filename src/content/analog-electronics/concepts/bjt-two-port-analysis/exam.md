# Exam Preparation: BJT Two-Port Analysis
## How This Is Tested
- Write h-parameter equations for a given configuration (5-8 marks)
- Calculate A_V, R_in, R_out using h-parameters (10-12 marks)
- Convert between parameter sets (5 marks)
- Cascade analysis using ABCD or loading (8-10 marks)
## Common Mistakes
1. Using CE h-params for a CB circuit (subscripts differ!)
2. Forgetting to include h_oe loading when R_L is large
3. Wrong signs when converting between parameter sets
4. Not accounting for inter-stage loading in cascades
