            "options": [
                "The diodes are too large",
                "There is no thin base region to enable transistor action",
                "Diodes only work with AC",
                "The doping levels are wrong"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "There is no thin base region to enable transistor action",
            "explanation": "In a real BJT, the base region is extremely thin (<1μm), allowing most electrons from the emitter to diffuse across and be collected. Two discrete diodes have thick, separate regions with no mechanism for carriers to transit from one junction to the other."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "CCCS (current-controlled current source)",
            "explanation": "In active mode, I_C = β I_B — the collector current is controlled by the base current. This is the definition of a Current-Controlled Current Source (CCCS). The base current is the input, the collector current is the proportional output."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "0.2V",
            "explanation": "In saturation, both junctions are forward-biased. V_CE = V_BE − V_BC ≈ 0.7 − 0.5 = 0.2V. This small residual voltage is why a saturated BJT acts like a closed switch with a tiny voltage drop."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Reverse biased",
            "explanation": "Active mode requires B-E forward biased and B-C reverse biased. The reverse-biased B-C junction acts as an open circuit in the model. The collector current β I_B flows due to transistor action (electrons swept from base to collector), not through the junction as a normal diode current."

            "correctAnswer": "10mA",
            "explanation": "I_C = β × I_B = 200 × 50μA = 200 × 50 × 10⁻⁶ = 10 × 10⁻³ = 10mA. The current gain β amplifies the tiny base current into a much larger collector current — this is the fundamental amplification mechanism."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "15.1mA",
            "explanation": "I_B = I_C/β = 15/150 = 0.1mA. By KCL: I_E = I_C + I_B = 15 + 0.1 = 15.1mA. The emitter current is slightly larger than the collector current because it includes the small base current."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Both junctions forward biased",
            "explanation": "Saturation occurs when both the B-E and B-C junctions are forward biased. In this state, I_C < β I_B — there is 'excess' base current. V_CE drops to ~0.2V. The transistor acts as a closed switch, not an amplifier."

            "correctAnswer": "V_CE > V_CE,sat (> 0.2V) and I_C = β I_B",
            "explanation": "Active mode requires: V_CE > V_CE,sat (ensuring B-C is reverse biased) AND I_C = β I_B (the amplification relationship holds). If your calculated V_CE ≤ 0.2V, the transistor is actually in saturation, and you must redo the analysis."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Electrons from emitter diffusing through the thin base and being collected",
            "explanation": "The heavily-doped emitter injects electrons into the thin base. Because the base is so narrow, most electrons (>99%) don't recombine — they diffuse across and are swept into the collector by the B-C junction's electric field. This 'transistor action' is what creates I_C = β I_B."

            "correctAnswer": "Open circuits",
            "explanation": "In cutoff, both junctions are reverse biased, so I_C = I_B = I_E = 0. All terminals are effectively open circuits — no current flows anywhere. The BJT behaves as if it's not there (or as an insulator)."
