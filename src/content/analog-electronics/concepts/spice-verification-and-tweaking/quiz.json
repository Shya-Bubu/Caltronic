            "id": "q1",
            "prompt": "A voltage gain of 600 corresponds to how many decibels?",
            "options": [
                "600 dB",
                "55.6 dB",
                "27.8 dB",
                "120 dB"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "55.6 dB",
            "explanation": "Av(dB) = 20 × log10(600) = 20 × 2.778 = 55.6 dB. Always convert to dB when working with Bode plots."

            "options": [
                "Gain drops to zero",
                "Gain drops to 50% of midband (half power point, or 0.707 of voltage gain)",
                "Phase reaches 180°",
                "The output becomes distorted"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Gain drops to 50% of midband (half power point, or 0.707 of voltage gain)",
            "explanation": "-3dB means the power is halved, which corresponds to voltage gain dropping to 1/√2 = 0.707 of the midband value. For this amplifier: 600 × 0.707 = 424.2."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Verify the DC operating point",
            "explanation": "If the DC bias is wrong, all AC analysis is meaningless. Check that node voltages match your calculations before proceeding with transient or frequency analysis."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Saturation clipping — Q-point too high, transistor enters saturation on negative swing",
            "explanation": "A flat bottom means VCE tried to go below VCE,sat. This is saturation clipping. The Q-point needs to be shifted higher (increase VCEQ) or the output swing needs to be reduced."

            "explanation": "For Xc ≤ Zin/10: C ≥ 10/(2π × 1000 × 8000) = 10/50265 = 0.0002F = 0.2μF. We choose larger (2.2μF) for safety."

                "The transistor burns out"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "R2 is not effectively shorted at AC, reducing the gain",
            "explanation": "CE is meant to bypass R2 at AC frequencies. If CE is too small, its impedance is significant and R2 adds emitter degeneration, reducing the gain. The midband gain becomes Av = hfe2×R5/(R2+R3) instead of hfe2×R5/R3."

                "270°"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "180°",
            "explanation": "The two-stage NPN-PNP cascade with the specific circuit topology produces a phase inversion of 180° in the midband. The output is inverted relative to the input."

                "The gain doubles",
                "VB1 increases, shifting the Q-point and causing clipping/saturation",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "VB1 increases, shifting the Q-point and causing clipping/saturation",
            "explanation": "Lower Ra means VB1 = Rb/(Ra+Rb) × VCC increases. This shifts IC1 up, changes VB2, and pushes Q2's operating point towards saturation. The professor demonstrated this causing severe clipping."

                "The computer rounds incorrectly",
                "Because we forgot to include the load"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "SPICE uses detailed transistor models (Ebers-Moll/Gummel-Poon) while hand calculations use simplified h-parameter models",
            "explanation": "SPICE uses the full nonlinear transistor model including all parasitic effects, temperature dependencies, and charge storage. Our h-parameter model is a linearised approximation valid only near the Q-point. Differences of 5-15% are normal."

            "id": "q10",
            "prompt": "With 5% tolerance resistors, the expected range of gain for a 600 target is:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "570 to 630",
            "explanation": "5% of 600 = ±30, so the range is 570 to 630. This assumes all resistors vary independently within their tolerance bands. In practice, the variation might be somewhat less due to statistical averaging."
