# Exam Preparation: Amplifier Classification

## How This Is Tested
- Draw the equivalent circuit model for each amplifier type (5-8 marks)
- Derive the actual gain including loading effects (8-10 marks)
- Compare ideal vs practical parameters (3-5 marks)

## Common Mistakes
1. Confusing Thévenin (voltage) vs Norton (current) output models
2. Getting R_in and R_out ideal values swapped between types
3. Forgetting the loading effect on both input and output sides
4. Not stating units for G_M (Siemens) and R_M (Ohms)
