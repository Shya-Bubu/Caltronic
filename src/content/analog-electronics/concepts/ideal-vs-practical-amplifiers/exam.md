# Exam Preparation: Ideal vs Practical Amplifiers
## How This Is Tested
- Calculate actual gain with specified R_in, R_out, R_S, R_L (8-10 marks)
- Explain saturation and draw clipped output waveform (5 marks)
- Compare technologies by input/output impedance (3-5 marks)
## Common Mistakes
1. Forgetting loading on BOTH input and output sides
2. Not accounting for saturation when signal is large
3. Confusing R_in requirements between amplifier types
