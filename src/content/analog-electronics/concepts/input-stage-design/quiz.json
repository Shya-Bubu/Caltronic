            "explanation": "KVL around the collector-emitter loop: VCC = ICQ1(R1+R2) + VCEQ1. Rearranging: R1+R2 = (VCC-VCEQ1)/ICQ1 = (15-6)/2.5mA = 3.6kΩ."

            "explanation": "ICQ2 = 25mA, ICQ1 = 2.5mA → ratio = 10:1. This ensures IC1 >> IB2 (the base current demand of Q2), so the loading effect of Q2 on Q1 is negligible."
