# Exam Guide — Two-Terminal Linear Elements

## How This Topic Appears in Exams

This is a foundational concept that appears in almost every exam — often not as a standalone question, but as the **starting knowledge** required to solve circuit problems. Questions test whether you can correctly:

- Apply the associated variable convention (determine power direction)
- Sketch V-I characteristics for basic elements
- Write element relationships from a circuit diagram
- Analyse a battery with internal resistance (Thévenin model)

## Typical Question Types

| Type | Marks | Time |
|------|-------|------|
| Sketch V-I characteristics for given elements | 4-6 | 5 min |
| Power calculation with sign convention | 3-4 | 3 min |
| Battery + load analysis (find terminal voltage) | 5-8 | 8 min |
| Identify elements from V-I plots | 3-5 | 4 min |

## Mark-Scoring Tips

1. **Always state the convention** you're using (associated or non-associated). Markers deduct marks when the reference direction is ambiguous.
2. **Label your V-I axes clearly** — $V$ on the horizontal axis, $I$ on the vertical axis (convention used in this course). Swapping axes loses marks.
3. For the battery + internal resistance question, **draw the Thévenin equivalent first**, then write the terminal voltage equation. Partial marks are awarded for the model even if the algebra is wrong.

## Common Mistakes

- Confusing slope of V-I plot (which is $G = 1/R$) with resistance $R$
- Forgetting to include the sign when the current direction opposes the assumed convention
- Stating that an ideal voltage source has zero internal resistance rather than showing it on the V-I plot
- Drawing the battery V-I line with positive slope (it should be negative)
