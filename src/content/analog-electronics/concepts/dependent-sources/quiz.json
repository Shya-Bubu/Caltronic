            "prompt": "A VCCS has the relationship I₂ = G_m V₁. The units of G_m are:",
            "options": [
                "Ohms (Ω)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Siemens (S) = A/V",
            "explanation": "G_m converts voltage (V) to current (A), so its units are A/V = siemens (S). This is called transconductance. Think of it as 'how many amps per volt' — the same unit as conductance G = 1/R."

            "id": "q2",
            "prompt": "Which dependent source type models a BJT in the active region?",

                "CCCS",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "CCCS",
            "explanation": "A BJT's collector current is controlled by its base current: I_C = β × I_B. The input is a current (I_B), the output is a current (I_C), so it's a Current-Controlled Current Source (CCCS). β is the current gain, typically 100-300."

            "id": "q3",

                "5000V"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "5V",
            "explanation": "V₂ = μ × V₁ = 1000 × 5mV = 5V. The VCVS amplifies the input voltage by the gain factor μ. This large gain from a small input is exactly how op-amps work — they are modeled as VCVS with very high μ."

                "Dependent sources use a diamond (◇), independent use a circle (○)",
                "Dependent sources are larger",
                "Dependent sources are drawn in red",
                "There is no visual difference"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Dependent sources use a diamond (◇), independent use a circle (○)",
            "explanation": "This is a universal convention in circuit diagrams. The diamond shape immediately tells you that the source's value depends on some other quantity in the circuit. The circle indicates a fixed, independent value."

            "id": "q5",

            "options": [
                "They don't have terminals",
                "Their value depends on circuit variables that change with each source",
                "They are always AC sources",
                "Superposition doesn't apply to any sources"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Their value depends on circuit variables that change with each source",
            "explanation": "A dependent source's output is controlled by a circuit variable (voltage or current). When you turn off independent sources one at a time, the circuit variables change, which changes the dependent source's output. You must keep dependent sources active throughout the analysis."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "6V",
            "explanation": "V₂ = r × I₁ = 2000Ω × 3mA = 6V. Notice r has units of ohms — it converts current (A) to voltage (V). 'Transresistance' means 'transfer resistance': the resistance-like quantity that relates input current to output voltage."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "VCCS",
            "explanation": "A MOSFET's drain current in saturation is controlled by the gate-source voltage: I_D = (K/2)(V_GS − V_T)². The input is a voltage (V_GS), the output is a current (I_D). In small-signal analysis, I_d = g_m × v_gs, which is a VCCS."

                "It has no physical meaning",
                "It relates current (A) to current (A) — same units cancel",
                "It is always equal to 1",
                "Convention requires it"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "It relates current (A) to current (A) — same units cancel",
            "explanation": "β = I₂/I₁ = amps/amps = dimensionless. When the control and output variables have the same units, the proportionality constant is a pure number. Same applies to μ in VCVS (volts/volts = dimensionless)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "4 (two ports)",
            "explanation": "A dependent source has two ports: the control port (2 terminals where the controlling variable is sensed) and the output port (2 terminals where the dependent voltage or current is produced). Total = 4 terminals."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "2V",
            "explanation": "V_out = A × (V₊ − V₋) = 200,000 × 10 × 10⁻⁶ = 200,000 × 10⁻⁵ = 2V. This demonstrates the extreme amplification of an op-amp: a 10 microvolt difference at the input produces a 2V output. In practice, the output is limited by the supply rails."
