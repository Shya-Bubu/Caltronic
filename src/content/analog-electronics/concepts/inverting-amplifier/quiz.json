            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Av = -R2/R1",
            "explanation": "The inverting amplifier gain is Av = -R2/R1. The negative sign indicates that the output is inverted (180° phase shift) relative to the input.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Inverting (-)",
            "explanation": "In an inverting amplifier, the input signal is applied through R1 to the INVERTING input (-). The non-inverting input (+) is grounded.",

            "correctAnswer": "Output is inverted relative to input",
            "explanation": "The negative gain means the output is phase-inverted (180° shift). When input goes positive, output goes negative, and vice versa.",

            "correctAnswer": "R1",
            "explanation": "The input impedance is simply R1. The virtual ground at the inverting node means the source 'sees' only R1 as the load. This is a disadvantage of the inverting configuration.",

            "correctAnswer": "-10V peak",
            "explanation": "Vo = Av × Vi = -20 × 0.5V = -10V peak. (Assuming no saturation) The negative means when input is +0.5V, output is -10V.",

            "correctAnswer": "0.7V",
            "explanation": "Max output ≈ 14V. Max input = Vsat/|Av| = 14V/20 = 0.7V. Any input larger causes the output to clip at ±14V.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Output saturates/clips",
            "explanation": "The output 'saturates' - it clips at approximately ±(Vsupply - 1V). This causes distortion in the waveform.",

            "correctAnswer": "Equal to 0 (ground)",
            "explanation": "Since V+ is grounded and the virtual short rule says V- = V+, therefore V- = 0. This is called 'virtual ground'.",

            "correctAnswer": "50kΩ",
            "explanation": "Av = -R2/R1, so -50 = -R2/1kΩ. Therefore R2 = 50kΩ. Always verify the design by plugging back into the formula!",
