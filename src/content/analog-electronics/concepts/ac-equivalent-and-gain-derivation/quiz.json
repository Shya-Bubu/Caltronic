            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Short circuits",
            "explanation": "A DC voltage source has zero AC impedance (it maintains a constant voltage regardless of current changes). In the small-signal model, VCC is shorted to ground because its AC voltage is zero — only the signal matters."

            "explanation": "hie is the input impedance (base-emitter resistance) measured at the transistor input with the output short-circuited for AC. For BC549, hie ≈ 2.7 kΩ and for BC556, hie ≈ 1.6 kΩ."

            "correctAnswer": "Av = hfe2 × R5 / R3",
            "explanation": "The simplified gain Av = hfe2 × R5 / R3 is derived by assuming R2 >> R3, ignoring hoe, and simplifying the interstage coupling. R3 is the gain-setting resistor — smaller R3 gives higher gain."

            "correctAnswer": "80.7 Ω (pick 82Ω from E12)",
            "explanation": "R3 = hfe2 × R5 / Av = 220 × 220 / 600 = 80.67 Ω. The nearest E12 value is 82 Ω. Choosing 68Ω would give Av ≈ 712, providing headroom for the loading effect of hie2."

            "correctAnswer": "Because hie2 (1.6kΩ) is comparable to R1 (1.8kΩ) — the ratio is only 1.1",
            "explanation": "The 10× rule requires R1/hie2 ≥ 10 for the approximation to be valid. Since R1/hie2 = 1800/1600 = 1.125, this ratio is far below 10, so hie2 significantly loads stage 1 and reduces the actual gain below the simplified formula."

            "correctAnswer": "R5 (220Ω)",
            "explanation": "Looking back from the output, Zout = R5 ∥ (1/hoe2) ≈ R5 since 1/hoe2 = 56kΩ >> R5 = 220Ω. The output impedance is dominated by R5, the emitter resistor of the PNP stage."

            "explanation": "At the signal frequency (typically 1 kHz), the capacitor impedance 1/(2πfC) is designed to be much smaller than surrounding resistors. They pass AC signals freely and are treated as short circuits in the small-signal model."

            "correctAnswer": "To compensate for gain loss due to hie2 loading — 68Ω gives Av ≈ 712 instead of 590",
            "explanation": "The simplified formula gives Av = 590 with R3 = 82Ω, but the actual gain is lower due to hie2 loading. Choosing R3 = 68Ω sets a theoretical Av ≈ 712, providing headroom so the actual gain (after losses) is closer to the target of 600."

                "Because it makes the math easier",

            "explanation": "The 10× rule: if one parallel resistor is 10× larger than the other, the parallel combination is within 10% of the smaller. Since 1/hoe ≈ 56kΩ >> R5 = 220Ω (ratio 254), the output conductance hoe has negligible effect."
