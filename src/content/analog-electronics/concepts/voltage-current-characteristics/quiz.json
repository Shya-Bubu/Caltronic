            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Resistance",
            "explanation": "Slope = ΔV/ΔI = R (Ohm's law: V = IR). If current is on y-axis and voltage on x-axis (I-V graph), slope would be conductance G = 1/R.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "An ohmic resistor",
            "explanation": "Linear V-I through origin means V = IR with constant R — the definition of an ohmic resistor. Diodes have exponential curves; batteries have non-zero intercepts; capacitors don't have simple V-I relationships.",

            "explanation": "R = V/I = 2V/1mA = 2kΩ, or 4V/2mA = 2kΩ, or 6V/3mA = 2kΩ. All points give the same R, confirming ohmic behavior.",

            "correctAnswer": "Poor linear fit — component may be non-ohmic",
            "explanation": "R² = 0.65 means only 65% of voltage variation is explained by a linear current relationship. Ohmic resistors typically show R² > 0.99. Low R² indicates non-linear behavior or excessive measurement noise.",

            "explanation": "At V = 10V: I = V/R = 10V / 2.2kΩ = 4.55mA. At V = 0: I = 0. So current spans 0 to ~4.5mA.",
