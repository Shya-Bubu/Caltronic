# Exam Preparation: Common-Emitter Amplifier
## How This Is Tested
- Calculate A_V, R_in, R_out from given circuit values (10-12 marks)
- Draw small-signal equivalent circuit (5-8 marks)
- Explain phase inversion and thermal stability (3-5 marks)
## Common Mistakes
1. Forgetting the negative sign in A_V (CE inverts!)
2. Not including R₁||R₂ in the input impedance calculation
3. Confusing bypassed vs unbypassed R_E analysis
