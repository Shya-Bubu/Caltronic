            "prompt": "The Ebers-Moll equation for a diode is I = I_S(e^(V/V_T) − 1). What is V_T at room temperature?",
            "options": [
                "0.7V",
                "0.3V",
                "25mV",
                "25V"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "25mV",
            "explanation": "V_T = kT/q is the thermal voltage, approximately 25-26 mV at room temperature (300K). This is NOT the 'turn-on voltage' (≈ 0.7V). The 0.7V value is where the exponential produces measurable milliamp currents, but V_T is the scaling factor in the exponent."

            "id": "q2",
            "prompt": "A silicon diode has I_S = 10⁻¹⁴ A. What is the forward current at V_D = 0.6V (V_T = 25mV)?",
            "options": [
                "About 26 μA",
                "About 2.6 A",
                "About 2.6 mA",
                "About 10⁻¹⁴ A"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "About 2.6 mA",
            "explanation": "I = I_S × e^(V_D/V_T) = 10⁻¹⁴ × e^(0.6/0.025) = 10⁻¹⁴ × e^24 ≈ 10⁻¹⁴ × 2.65 × 10¹⁰ = 2.65 × 10⁻⁴ A ≈ 0.26 mA. The exact answer depends on precision, but it's in the fraction-of-milliamp range at 0.6V, reaching full milliamps closer to 0.7V."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "5Ω",
            "explanation": "Dynamic resistance r_d ≈ V_T / I_D = 25mV / 5mA = 5Ω. This is the small-signal resistance — the slope of the V-I curve at the operating point. It's small because the exponential curve is very steep at milliamp currents."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Nonlinear — cubic characteristic",
            "explanation": "The relationship I = αV³ is not of the form I = GV (linear). The conductance G = dI/dV = 3αV² depends on V, making this a nonlinear element. Its V-I plot is a cubic curve, steeper at higher voltages."

            "correctAnswer": "You characterise it only by its V-I relationship at the terminals",
            "explanation": "The black-box approach is fundamental: any two-terminal element, regardless of internal construction, is completely described by the relationship between terminal voltage V and current I. You don't need to know what's inside."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "0.6-0.7V",
            "explanation": "Silicon diodes appear to 'turn on' around 0.6-0.7V because the exponential function e^(V/0.025) reaches values that produce milliamp currents at this voltage. Below this, current exists but is negligibly small (picoamps to nanoamps). Germanium diodes have a knee around 0.3V."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "−1/R_load",
            "explanation": "The load line comes from KVL: V_supply = V_D + I·R_load, giving I = (V_supply − V_D)/R_load = −V_D/R_load + V_supply/R_load. The slope ΔI/ΔV = −1/R_load (negative), which makes sense: higher voltage across the diode means less left for the resistor, so less current."

            "correctAnswer": "−I_S ≈ −10⁻¹⁴ A",
            "explanation": "At V_D = −5V: I = I_S(e^(−5/0.025) − 1) = I_S(e^(−200) − 1) ≈ I_S(0 − 1) = −I_S. The exponential term is essentially zero for any significant reverse voltage, leaving a tiny reverse saturation current of about −10⁻¹⁴ A."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Graphical load-line method",
            "explanation": "Superposition only works for linear circuits. The load-line method plots the diode's nonlinear V-I curve and the circuit's linear constraint (load line) on the same axes — their intersection gives the operating point. SPICE uses numerical methods for more complex circuits."

            "correctAnswer": "Temperature",
            "explanation": "I_S is a strong function of temperature — it roughly doubles for every 10°C increase. This comes from the semiconductor physics: I_S depends on the intrinsic carrier concentration nᵢ, which increases exponentially with temperature. V_T also depends on temperature (V_T = kT/q), but I_S is far more sensitive."
