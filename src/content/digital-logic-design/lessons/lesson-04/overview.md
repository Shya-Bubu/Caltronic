# Special Logic Circuits

## What You'll Learn

This lesson covers the arithmetic building blocks that make computers compute. You'll learn how digital circuits perform addition, subtraction, and data selection — the core operations behind every calculator, processor, and digital system.

## Why It Matters

Understanding these circuits is essential for:
- **Processor Design** — ALUs are the computational heart of CPUs
- **Number Systems** — How computers represent negative numbers
- **Data Routing** — How multiplexers select and route data
- **Optimization** — Building efficient multi-bit arithmetic units

## Core Questions We'll Answer

1. How do computers add binary numbers?
2. How are negative numbers represented in digital systems?
3. How can one circuit perform both addition AND subtraction?
4. How do multiplexers select between multiple data sources?

## Prerequisites

- Basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR)
- Truth tables and Boolean expressions
- Binary number representation
