# Processing of Logical Information

## What You'll Learn

This lesson introduces the fundamental building blocks of all digital systems. Every computer, smartphone, and digital device you use is built from simple logic gates that process binary information.

## Why It Matters

Understanding logic gates is essential for:
- **Circuit Design** — Creating efficient digital circuits from basic components
- **Troubleshooting** — Diagnosing issues in digital systems
- **Optimization** — Minimizing circuit complexity, cost, and power consumption
- **Programming** — Understanding how hardware executes your code

## Core Questions We'll Answer

1. How do electronic circuits represent TRUE and FALSE?
2. What are the fundamental logic operations (AND, OR, NOT)?
3. How can we combine gates to perform complex operations?
4. How do we design a circuit from a problem specification?
5. How do we minimize circuits using Boolean algebra?

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of binary numbers (0 and 1)
- Familiarity with basic algebra concepts
